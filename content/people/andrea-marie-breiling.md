short_bio: "Born in Phoenix, AZ, US, and lives and works in Los Angeles, CA,
  USA. In her work, Los Angeles-based artist Andrea Marie Breiling articulates
  everyday experiences in a physical form. Breiling often draws on art
  historical sources, such as the gesture of Abstract Expressionists. Her
  energetic way of working gives rise to highly abstract, intensely colored
  compositions that at times even seem calligraphic. Breiling has had solo
  exhibitions at Night Gallery, Los Angeles, CA;  Achenbach Hagemeier,
  Düsseldorf, Germany; and Peggy Phelps Gallery, Claremont, CA, among others. In
  2021 she will mount a solo exhibition at Broadway, New York, NY. "
