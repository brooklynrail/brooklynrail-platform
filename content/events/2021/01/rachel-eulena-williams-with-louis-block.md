      An artist working at the boundaries between painting and sculpture. Her
      reconfigured canvases unbind painting from the stretcher, avoiding
      conventional support systems and imagining a myriad of spatial
      contortions. Her evident interest in color represents a liberation from,
      and criticality of, Western art history’s othering of color, and
      categorizing it as unruly, foreign, and vulgar. Instead, her interest in
      imagining unrestrained structures exceeds those boundaries and is
      partially inspired by science fiction. Williams’ drawings also manipulate
      the way images are presented, playing with assumptions about virtuosity
      through abstraction.


      Williams received a B.F.A. from Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York in 2013. Her work has been exhibited internationally at Loyal Gallery, Stockholm (2019), Ceysson & Bénétière, Sainte Etienne (2018), Night Gallery, Los Angeles (2018), Derek Eller Gallery, New York (2018), Cooper Cole, Toronto (2018), The Journal Gallery, Brooklyn, NY (2017), Mass Gallery, Austin (2017), SomeTime Salon, San Francisco (2017), and Center Street, New York (2017). Williams has held the SIP Fellowship at the Robert Blackburn Printmaking Workshop, New York (2019), 68 Projects, Berlin (2018), and NY Studio Factory, Brooklyn (2014). Rachel Eulena Williams currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York, USA.
