short_bio: Widely recognized for his sculptures and public art installations,
  **Will Ryman**’s work is filled with an acute theatricality that harkens back
  to his early career as a playwright. The artist’s ongoing interest in
  literature, philosophy, and the Theatre of the Absurd manifests in his playful
  investigation of the folly of existence and our shared search for meaning and
  resolve. Material and subject are of equal importance for Ryman, whose work
  reveals his intuitive approach to sculpting diverse materials into expressive
  forms that examine essential aspects of the human experience.
