first_name: Vera List Center for Art and Politics
short_bio: The Vera List Center for Art and Politics is an artist-focused
  research center and public forum for art, culture, and politics. It was
  established at The New School in 1992—a time of rousing debates about freedom
  of speech, identity politics, and society’s investment in the arts. A leader
  in the field, the center is a nonprofit that catalyzes and supports
  politically engaged art, public scholarship, and research throughout the
  world. It fosters vibrant and diverse communities of artists, scholars, and
  policymakers who take creative, intellectual, and political risks to bring
  about positive change.
