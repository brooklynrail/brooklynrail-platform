    event_bio: Sanford Biggers (b. 1970) was raised in Los Angeles and currently
      lives and works in New York City. His work is an interplay of narrative,
      perspective and history that speaks to current social, political and
      economic happenings while also examining the contexts that bore them. His
      diverse practice positions him as a collaborator with the past through
      explorations of often overlooked cultural and political narratives from
      American history. Working with antique quilts that echo rumors of their
      use as signposts on the Underground Railroad, he engages these legends and
      contributes to this narrative by drawing and painting directly onto them.
      In response to ongoing occurrences of police brutality against Black
      Americans, Biggers’ BAM series is composed of bronze sculptures recast
      from fragments of wooden African statues that have been anonymized through
      dipping in wax and then ballistically ‘resculpted’. Following a residency
      as a 2017 American Academy Fellow in Rome, the artist recently began
      working in marble. Drawing on and playing with the tradition of working in
      this medium, Biggers creates hybridized forms that transpose, combine and
      juxtapose classical and historical subjects to create alternative meanings
      and produce what he calls “future ethnographies”. As creative director and
      keyboardist, he fronts Moon Medicin, a multimedia concept band that
      straddles visual art and music with performances staged against a backdrop
      of curated sound effects and video. Moon Medicin performed at Open Spaces
      Kansas City in October 2018 and at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C.
      in 2019.
