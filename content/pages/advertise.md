Founded in October 2000, the Brooklyn Rail provides an independent forum for arts, culture, and politics. It is for those who read and think critically about art, culture, and our society. We publish 10 issues a year and distribute free of charge in print, online, and on Instagram. Copies of the Rail can be found around New York City in cultural institutions, colleges, and a growing list of national and international subscribers. Our readership includes students, influential artists, writers, professors, curators, collectors and leaders in the arts.

- **Print readership:** +200,000 annually
- **Online + Newsletter readership:** +160,000 unique visitors monthly
- **Instagram:** +52,000 followers

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, The Brooklyn Rail has inaugurated [The New Social Environment](https://brooklynrail.org/events), a daily online forum for artists, writers, filmmakers, and cultural curators to discuss creative life in the context of our new reality. If you're interested in becoming a sponsor, please email Catherine Olson [catherine@brooklynrail.org](mailto:catherine@brooklynrail.org).

Our advertising program helps keep the Rail free and independent. Thank you for your support!

> _“The Brooklyn Rail forges communities across cultural disciplines, boroughs, and ideologies. A brilliantly conceived and beautifully executed newspaper, The Rail is making an absolutely crucial contribution to the intellectual life of the city and even the nation.”_ — Richard Serra
