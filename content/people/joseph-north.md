short_bio: '**Joseph North** is the author of _Literary Criticism: A Concise
  Political History._ He is currently at work on two further books. _Our Mobs_

  political feeling nowadays (e.g recent moral panics about "woke mobs," "antifa
  mobs," "BLM mobs," "twitter mobs," and - differently - "the mob that stormed
  the Capitol"). _The Aesthetic Life of Centrism_ is a history, analysis and
  critique of political centrism over the last two centuries, focusing
  especially on its aesthetic and literary elements. North teaches literature at
  Yale. '
