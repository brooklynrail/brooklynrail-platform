short_bio: Brooklyn-based artist whose work joins together painting and drawing,
  abstraction and representation in non-traditional ways. Imbued with a sense of
  personal iconography, his practice often combines signature figurative
  elements, such as bug-eyed humans and eclectic headgear with gestural,
  abstract blocks of color.  His paintings employ an aggressive use of color and
  texture with various combinations of oil, enamel, spray paint and collage
  elements on canvas. Martinez also produces large and small-scale abstract
  sculpture, made mostly from found materials such as rubber hoses, Styrofoam,
  cardboard, and metal scraps sourced from wherever the artist is working at the
  time.
