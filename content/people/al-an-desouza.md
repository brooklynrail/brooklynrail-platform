short_bio: "**Al-An deSouza** is an artist working across photo-media,
  installation, text and performance. They draw upon official and informal
  archives, remaking them through strategies of humor, fabulation, and
  (mis)translation. deSouza has exhibited extensively in the US and
  internationally, including at the Johnson Museum, Ithaca, NY, Krannert Museum,
  IL; Phillips Collection, Washington, DC; Pompidou Centre, Paris, and the Mori
  Museum, Tokyo. deSouza, a professor of Art Practice at University of
  California, Berkeley, has published numerous essays and two recent books: _How
  Art Can Be Thought, A Handbook for Change_ (2018), and _Ark of Martyrs_
  (2020), a polyphonic, dysphoric replacement of Joseph Conradâ€™s infamous _Heart
  of Darkness._ "
