  - person: dean-daderko
    event_bio: Dean Daderko is a curator based in New York. He received his BFA in
      sculpture in 1997 from the Tyler School of Art. His most recent
      exhibitions, 50 Artists Photograph The Future and Piece de Resistance,
      were presented by Higher Pictures and Larissa Goldston Gallery,
      respectively. SIDE X SIDE, an exhibition he guest curated for Visual AIDS,
      explored the impact of AIDS on a first generation of artists faced with
      the epidemic. He has also curated exhibitions and created programs for Art
      in General, Artists’ Space, and The Kitchen in New York, and for the
      Contemporary Art Center in Vilnius, Lithuania. His writing has appeared in
      publications by the Studio Museum in Harlem, El Museo del Barrio, P.S.1
      Contemporary Art Center, and the Australian Centre for Contemporary Arts.
      He is the recipient of a Curatorial Research Fellowship in 2008-09 from
      the French American Cultural Exchange, and has been a Curator of The
      Americas In Residence at the Fonderie Darling in Montreal, Quebec,
      sponsored by the Conseil des arts de Montreal. Mr. Daderko was appointed
      critic in painting/printmaking at Yale in 2010.
  - person: eleanor-heartney
    event_bio: "Eleanor Heartney is well known as a curator and critic, a long-time
      contributing editor of Art in America and the author of numerous books,
      including Art & Today, Postmodernism, and After the Revolution: Women Who
      Transformed Contemporary Art. Her latest study looks at the ways in which
      a Catholic heritage and sensibility infuse the works of many major artists
      of the last 50 years. We may think of Andy Warhol, Robert Mapplethorpe,
      Vito Acconci, Karen Finley, and Andres Serrano as iconoclastic figures,
      eager to raise the hackles of the establishment and upend the status quo.
      But as Heartney points out in the recently re-issued edition of her book
      Postmodern Heretics: The Catholic Imagination in Contemporary Art (Silver
      Hollow Press), these artists also grappled with the legacy of their
      religious upbringings, reconciling the sacred and the profane and paying
      homage in unusual ways to typically Catholic themes—the Crucifixion, the
      nature of the body vs. the spirit, and a preoccupation with death—that
      have run through sacred art since the Renaissance. Her most recent book is
      Doomsday Dreams: The Apocalyptic Imagination in Contemporary Art (Silver
      Hollow Press, 2019). She is an Editor-at-Large at the Brooklyn Rail. "
  - person: charlotte-kent
    event_bio: Charlotte Kent, PhD is Assistant Professor of Visual Culture in the
      Department of Art and Design at Montclair State University. She received
      her PhD in Comparative Literature (CUNY Graduate Center), with a
      certificate in critical theory. Her dissertation focused on the narratives
      and rhetoric of art writing, with grant funded research at Tate Modern, to
      contextualize the problematics of the Homeland Security Agency’s claim “if
      you see something, say something.” Currently, she is co-editing a
      collection on the absurd in contemporary art. Beyond scholarly
      contributions to essay collections and journals, Charlotte produces
      exhibition reviews for Brooklyn Rail, opinion pieces for Clot, and feature
      articles as well as monthly column for Artists Magazine. In 2019-2020, she

      of posts on the topic of Collaboration.

      Founded by artists Martin Weinstein and Teresa Liszka in 1981, Art in
      General has provided space and funding to local and international artists
      to realize new work.


      From 1981 to 2015, Art in General was located at 79 Walker Street in Manhattan, in a six-floor building owned by General Hardware Manufacturing Inc. (formerly General Tools & Instruments LLC), hence the organization’s name. Located at the intersection of three neighborhoods in New York City (Tribeca, SoHo, and Chinatown), Art in General has since its founding been committed to presenting new work by artists of color, women, immigrants and visiting artists. In 2003, Gerry Weinstein, CEO of General Tools & Instruments LLC, donated the storefront to Art in General for use as a gallery. In 2006, the sixth-floor gallery underwent a major renovation by Steven Learner Studios and was re-opened in January 2007 with Le Musée Minuscule, created in honor of New Langton Arts’ former space of the same name. After the building was sold and changed ownership, Art in General temporarily moved to 20 Jay Street/145 Plymouth Street in DUMBO from 2016 to 2020.

# **THANK YOU**

# **CLOSING THOUGHTS & SIGNS OF CHANGE**

*From Art in General*

> After careful deliberation and long discussions over the past six months, the Board of Directors and the Executive Director have arrived at the difficult decision to close Art in General, upon reaching the milestone of our 40th anniversary. Although we have taken critical measures to adjust to the new normal, the financial constriction due to the COVID-19 pandemic has proved formidable, severely affecting our ability to fulfill our mission of presenting new work by emerging and mid-career artists to the New York area.
>
> Since 1981, **[Art in General](http://www.artingeneral.org)** has proudly shown over 2,000 artists who have gone onto greater success, including Dorothea Rockburne, Joan Jonas, Kay WalkingStick, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Glenn Ligon, Byron Kim, Elizabeth Peyton, Marina Abramovic, Gabriel Orozco, Paul Pfeiffer, William Pope.L, Pipilotti Rist, Francis Alys, Walid Raad, Sharon Hayes, Patty Chang, Allora & Calzadilla, Pierre Huyghe, among many others. Our roster of artists reflects our deep and long-standing commitment to diversity and equity in the arts. To secure this legacy, we have donated our archives to the **[Smithsonian Archives of American Art](https://www.aaa.si.edu/)**, where students and scholars may find materials about our past programs, as well as founding documents and the entirety of Holly Block’s papers during her 18-year tenure as Art in General’s pioneering first director. To complement the papers at the Smithsonian, we also donated a complete set of publications by Art in General to **[New York University Special Collections — Fales Library, Downtown Collection](https://guides.nyu.edu/downtown-collection)**. Our remaining inventory of books and printed materials were gifted to **[Art Resources Transfer](https://www.artresourcestransfer.org/)**, a nonprofit organization committed to the egalitarian access to the arts and literacy. Through their Distribution to Underserved Communities Library Program, A.R.T. will disperse Art in General’s publications free-of-charge to rural and inner-city public libraries, schools, prisons, and alternative education centers nationwide.
>
> We are proud to present our last New Commission, ***[Project 270: Signs of Change](http://www.artingeneral.org/exhibitions/706)*** and online exhibition ***[Dropped By and Found You: #DroppedByAiG](http://www.artingeneral.org/exhibitions/704)***.
