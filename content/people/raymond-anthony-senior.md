short_bio: "Hopeless romantic **Raymond Anthony Senior** writes mostly of love.
  Born in Kingston, Jamaica raised in St. Elizabeth Parrish, a descendent of the
  Maroons, the Arawak, and Irish-German settlers Raymond finds strength and
  solace in himself, his identity, and his connection to those who came before
  him.  Despite being orphaned as a child, he has always felt driven by love and
  family. The singer-songwriter and poet wrote some popular songs you might’ve
  heard in the 80’s. He is the author of several poetry collections including
  _True Love Never Fails_ (Trafford Publishing) among many others.  "
