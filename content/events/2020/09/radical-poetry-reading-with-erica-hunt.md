      the Apple Falls, and anthologies, including Role Call: A Generational
      Anthology of Social & Political Black Literature & Art, exist. Sometimes
      she makes poems of dirt. Sometimes zeros and ones. Sometimes variously
      rendered text. Sometimes light. She lives in Portland, Oregon, with a
      magic cat who shares her obsession with trees and blackbirds and
      occasionally crashes her classes and poetry salons at Reed College."
