short_bio: "An artist living and working in Brooklyn. Since 2008, Sam Moyer has
  developed a distinctive language of abstraction that considers questions of
  value, labor and beauty. Her practice has evolved from its more conceptual and
  process-based origins to address formal and theoretical issues regarding the
  construct of painting. Examining traditional roles of painting and sculpture,
  Moyer reframes the painted surface as a sculptural field in which fragments of
  previously used stone are paired with hand-painted canvas to create dynamic
  compositions. She manipulates these found textures and materials into powerful
  and evocative abstract works that evince beauty, humor, balance and chance,
  employing the hand-made and readymade. "
