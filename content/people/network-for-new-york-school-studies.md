name: Network for New York School Studies
first_name: Network for New York School Studies
short_bio: The **Network for New York School Studies** (NNYSS) endeavors to
  enable novel interactions regarding New York School Poetryâ€”between academics,
  creative practitioners, cultural organizations, and members of the public, as
  well as facilitating the free exchange of ideas across national borders,
  disciplinary boundaries, and cultural sectors. In so doing, the Network
  supports the development of innovative critical and creative projects, the
  breaking down of barriers between academia and other art forms, and the
  transfer of scholarly and creative outputs to audiences not usually
  effectively reached by academic research.
