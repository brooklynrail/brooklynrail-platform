~~SLACKERS~~

**3 GenX Poets on Place & Power**

*:: A Winter Solstice Special Event ::*

Samiya Bashir (Executive Director, Lambda Literary) invites Carmen Gimenez (Publisher, Graywolf Press), and Adrian Matejka (Editor, Poetry Magazine) to share current work, sip cocktails, and talk intersectional power, presence, and taking their place at the helm of institutions which once stood as gatekeepers to their exclusion.
