      Ann Sutherland Harris, PhD, is Professor Emerita at the University of
      Pittsburgh. Her research and teaching have embraced a wide range of topics
      in the history of art and architecture in European late Renaissance and
      seventeenth-century art in various media. The literature on
      seventeenth-century Italian painters was sparse in the 1960s when she
      began her career. She helped to reconstruct the careers of several
      artists, including P. F. Mola and Pietro Testa, by publishing documentary
      information, identifying both paintings and drawings by them and creating
      a more logical chronology of their work. Her monograph on Andrea Sacchi
      (1599-1661) is regarded as one of the best of the studies on a major
      seicento painter published in recent years. She also specializes in
      artists’ drawings, both their correct identification, and their function
      in the production of both painting and sculpture, with particular emphasis
      on the drawings of Gian Lorenzo Bernini. She has identified and published
      drawings by Michelangelo, Bernini, Nicolas Poussin, Claude Lorrain, and
      many less well-known artists. She has also been interested in the
      education of artists, including the role of academies and artists’ levels
      of literacy. Her book _Seventeenth-Century Art and Architecture_ (Laurence
      King, London, 2005; 2nd ed., 2008) is used widely as a textbook on this
      vast historical period. Dr. Sutherland Harris co-curated with Linda
      Nochlin the groundbreaking exhibition _Women Artists, 1550-1950_, which
      premiered at the Los Angeles County Museum in 1976 (and then traveled to
      the University Art Museum, Austin, Texas; Carnegie Museum of Art,
      Pittsburgh; and Brooklyn Museum, New York). The exhibition was the very
      first exhibition at a major museum in the U.S. dedicated to women artists
      and it helped reclaim and resurrect women artists who had long been lost
      to history. For the exhibition, she was responsible for artists active in
      the 16th to 18th centuries and contributed the catalogue entries for the
      artists working before 1800, as well as an introduction that provided the
      essential historical background for the pioneering women artists who
      emerged in Europe in the mid-sixteenth-century. Feminist activism has
      played a large role in Sutherland Harris’ career. In 1970, she testified
      before the US Congress about the discrimination faced by women in higher
      education, and then helped to establish the Women’s Caucus for Art, an
      advocacy organization for women active as artists, art historians, and
      museum professionals; she served as its first President (1972-74). She has
      continually written about women artists of the past and present, including
      Artemisia Gentileschi, Sofonisba Anguissola, Lavinia Fontana, Elisabetta
      Sirani, Alice Neel, Elizabeth Murray, Edna Andrade, among others. Dr.
      Sutherland Harris received her PhD from the Courtauld Institute of the
      University of London.
