short_bio: "**Vik Muniz** lives and works in New York, NY and Rio de Janeiro,
  Brazil. He is involved in social projects that use art-making as a force for
  change. In 2010 his work with a group of  _catadores_—pickers of recyclable
  materials—was the subject of the Academy Award-nominated documentary
  film  _Waste Land_. In recognition of his contributions to education and
  social development, Muniz was named a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador in 2011. In
  2017, he founded Escola Vidigal, offering preschool and after-school programs
  in art, design, and technology to children 4 to 8 years old at the favela
  Vidigal in Rio de Janeiro. His work was most recently on view in  _Flora
  Industrialis_  at Museo Universidad de Navarra, Spain (2023-24), among many
  other solo exhibitions. "
