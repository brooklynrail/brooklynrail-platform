National Academicians **Sanford Biggers**, **Willie Cole**, and **Mel Kendrick** will participate in a moderated discussion about formal innovation through the use and reuse of materials, hybridity, and the melding of different traditions of making. The discussion is presented in partnership with the ***Brooklyn Rail***, and moderated by **William Corwin**. In ancient Greek, the term synkrētismos meant a “union of communities,” specifically to oppose a common enemy. Only in the seventeenth century was the word Anglicized to mean “the union of different religious beliefs.” This term now filled an emerging descriptive need for a process of cultural diffusion and hybridity that emerged through colonization. The artists will discuss how syncretism, with its fraught history, relates to their sculptural practices, and how looking back to move forward informs their work.

**Sanford Biggers NA** was raised in Los Angeles and currently lives and works in New York City. Biggers’ work is an interplay of narrative, perspective, and history that speaks to current social, political, and economic happenings, while examining the contexts that bore them. His diverse practice positions him as a collaborator with the past through explorations of often-overlooked cultural and political narratives from American history.

 **Willie Cole NA** is a conceptual artist, who transforms objects, from steam irons to high-heeled shoes, into sculptures, installations, and works on paper. Mining his heritage and confronting the legacies of slavery in the United States, Cole creates work that uncovers ways objects store memories.

 **Mel Kendrick NA** is a preeminent American sculptor, whose thoroughgoing practice has involved the use of cast bronze, concrete, a variety of woods, rubber, resin, as well as investigations with cast paper. Kendrick addresses philosophical, conceptual, and fundamental questions around sculpture: namely, the relationship between the object as we experience it and the clearly evident means by which it was created.
