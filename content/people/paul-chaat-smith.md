short_bio: "Paul Chaat Smith (Comanche) joined the Smithsonian’s National Museum
  of the American Indian in 2001, where he now serves as Curator. His
  exhibitions include Americans, Stretching the Canvas, James Luna’s Emendatio,
  Fritz Scholder: Indian/Not Indian, and Brian Jungen: Strange Comfort. He’s the
  coauthor of Like a Hurricane: the Indian Movement from Alcatraz to Wounded
  Knee (The New Press, 1996), and Everything You Know about Indians Is Wrong
  (University of Minnesota Press, 2009). Although he spends most of his time
  crafting game-changing exhibitions and texts, he also enjoys reading
  obsessively about the early days of the Soviet space program, watching massive
  amounts of televised sports (pandemics permitting), and writing about himself
  in the third person."
