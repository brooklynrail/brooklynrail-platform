short_bio: "As an avowed eco-feminist, **Faith Wildingâ€™s** work addresses the
  deterioration of the natural world in her lifetime, specifically in South
  America and her native Paraguay. She depicts symmetrical dualities: up and
  down, in and out, open and closed, evoking mystical, personal, and esoteric
  narratives. The works express interconnectedness and spiritual exuberance,
  while exploring visionary iconology of the energy and force of growth."
