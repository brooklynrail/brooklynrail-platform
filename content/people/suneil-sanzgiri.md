short_bio: "**Suneil Sanzgiri** is an artist, researcher, and filmmaker.
  Spanning experimental video and film, animations, essays, and installations,
  his work contends with questions of identity, heritage, culture, and diaspora
  in relation to structural violence and anticolonial struggles across the
  Global South. Sanzgiri’s films offer sonic and visual journeys through family
  history, local mythology, and colonial legacies of extraction in Goa,
  India—where his family originates—deftly utilizing and vividly blending
  together 3D renderings, drone videography, photogrammetry and lidar scanning,
  16 mm film and animation, archival footage, and desktop documentary practices.
  Sanzgiri’s work has been screened extensively at festivals and venues around
  the world and is the recipient of numerous awards."
