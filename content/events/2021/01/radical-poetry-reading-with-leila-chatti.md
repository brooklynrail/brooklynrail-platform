      Bob Holman is an American poet and poetry activist, most closely
      identified with the oral tradition, the spoken word, and poetry slam. As a
      promoter of poetry in many media, Holman has spent the last four decades
      working variously as an author, editor, publisher, performer, emcee of
      live events, director of theatrical productions, producer of films and
      television programs, record label executive, university professor, and
      archivist. He was described by Henry Louis Gates Jr. in The New Yorker as
      “the postmodern promoter who has done more to bring poetry to cafes and
      bars than anyone since Ferlinghetti.”


      Bob is a contributor of the Brooklyn Rail. His two new books, The Unspoken and Life Poem, were written 50 years apart. You can order them from YBK Publishers.
