short_bio: "Poet and a scholar, **Charles Bernstein** is a foundational member
  and leading practitioner of Language poetry. From 1978 to 1981, alongside
  fellow poet Bruce Andrews, he published _L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E_ magazine, which
  became a forum for writing that blurred, confused, and denied the boundary
  between poetry and critical writing about poetry. Since the 1970s Bernstein
  has published dozens of books, including poetry as well as essay collections,
  pamphlets, translations, collaborations, and libretti. His poetry has been
  widely anthologized and translated, and it has appeared in over 500 magazines
  and periodicals. His most recent book _Topsy-Turvy_ will be released later
  this month by the University of Chicago Press. "
