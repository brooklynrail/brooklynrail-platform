  vice-president of the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute, Chongqing. Since 2018 he
  has been leading various socially engaged rural art projects in Southwest
  China, including Qitang Experimental Field and Lotus Hole: Chongqing Village
  Art Festival. His most recent work as an artist is conceptual, a comment on
  the consumerist excesses of today’s society. He transforms objects—often
  packaging, such as a discarded Hermès box—with scale and fibre glass to make
  pieces of statement art."
