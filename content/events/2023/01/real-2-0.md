[Barbara London](https://www.barbaralondon.net/about/) will moderate an expansive panel discussion on how artists have appropriated the medium of virtual reality to create immersive artworks. Panelists including [Mattia Casalegno](http://www.mattiacasalegno.net/), [Hsin-Chien Haung](https://hsinchienhuang.com/) (via Zoom), and [Rachel Rossin](https://rossin.co/) will interrogate the medium of VR, addressing questions such as: Can art be virtual? Does the virtual contradict the real? What is the future of the medium? 

The panel discussion takes place in conjunction with Pratt Manhattan Gallery’s current exhibition, *Hsin-Chien Huang: The Data We Called Home*, curated by Professor Linda Lauro-Lazin. 

*Real 2.0* is free and open to the public; [registration](https://www.eventbrite.ch/e/real-20-artists-discuss-immersive-art-in-the-virtual-landscape-tickets-491969442847) is required.

Pratt Manhattan Campus, 144 West 14th Street, NY 10011, Room 201.
