short_bio: "**Elise Armani** is a curator and Ph.D. candidate in Art History and
  Criticism at Stony Brook University. Her dissertation examines immigrant
  artist networks on Manhattan's Lower East Side in the 1970s-80s, demonstrating
  how artistic practices were intertwined with the cultivation of community
  oriented spaces and resources in response to municipal and commercial
  divestment. She has contributed to projects at the Solomon R. Guggenheim
  Museum, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Walker Art Center, the Weisman Art
  Museum, and TANK Shanghai. She recently co-curated **Revisiting 5+1** at the
  Paul W. Zuccaire Gallery, presented in partnership with the MFA Boston, and
  co-edited the accompanying catalog."
