> “My son was murdered in 2014. George Floyd was murdered in 2020. Those were not the only two murders that happened. Every time that you hear another Black unarmed man being killed, shot in the back, or banged up against the sidewalk, or tased to death, you say, 'Oh my God, that’s my son again.’” –Gwen Carr
>
> "I couldn’t watch the video. I said to myself 'here we go again.’” –Valerie Bell
