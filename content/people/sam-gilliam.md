short_bio: One of the great innovators in postwar American painting. He emerged
  from the Washington, D.C. scene in the mid 1960s with works that elaborated
  upon and disrupted the ethos of Color School painting. A series of formal
  breakthroughs resulted in his canonical Drape paintings, which expanded upon
  the tenets of Abstract Expressionism in entirely new ways. Suspending
  stretcherless lengths of painted canvas from the walls or ceilings, Gilliam
  transformed his medium and the contexts in which it was viewed. As an
  African-American artist in the nation’s capital at the height of the Civil
  Rights Movement, this was not merely an aesthetic proposition; it was a way of
  defining art’s role in a society undergoing dramatic change.
