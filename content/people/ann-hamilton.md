short_bio: "**Ann Hamilton** is a visual artist internationally acclaimed for
  her large-scale multimedia installations, public projects, and performance
  collaborations. Her site-responsive process works with common materials to
  invoke particular places, collective voices, and communities of labor. Noted
  for a dense accumulation of materials, her ephemeral environments create
  immersive experiences that poetically respond to the architectural presence
  and social history of their sites. From 1985 to 1991, she taught on the
  faculty of the University of California at Santa Barbara. Hamilton has served
  on the faculty of The Ohio State University since 2001, where she is a
  Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Art."
