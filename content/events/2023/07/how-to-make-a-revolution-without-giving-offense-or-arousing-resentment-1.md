*The Brooklyn Rail* is proud to present *How To Make A Revolution Without Giving Offense Or Arousing Resentment*, a new play by **Kim Golding,** **Jordan Jones,** and **Sam Myers.** The play tells a story about T, a melancholy marketing associate prompted to respond to an Unnamed Tragedy while working at The Museum. The Museum is well-intentioned, misguided, self-interested, self-protecting, and ultimately self-sustaining. After finding a mysterious zine page on their office printer, T stumbles upon a group of revolutionary anti-Museum organizers daring to imagine something different. Their process inspires T to dream of new ways for their voice and body to take up space. Through the escalating battle between the zine team and the Museum, the play explores how we make our ideas physical and communicable, and how form, context, and process shape their ultimate impact. The play will feature **Tẹmídayọ Amay, Sarah Chalfie, Tony Jenkins, Arjun Biju**, and **Nile Assata Harris**. **Ryan Gedrich** is the show’s producer, and the creative team includes **Wesley Cornwell** (Scenic Design), **Jacqueline Scaletta** (Lighting Design), and **Nick Auer** and **Dan Kuan Peeples** (Sound and Projection Design); **Cara Kienitz** is the Stage Manager. There will be three presentations of the play—all free and open to the public—spanning August 18 and 19 at the Rail’s pop-up gallery in Industry City ([900 3rd Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11232](https://goo.gl/maps/wVyykp2vr9zDAjme8)). 

Space will be limited, so we recommend RSVPing in advance.
