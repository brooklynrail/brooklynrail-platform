short_bio: An Iranian-born visual artist and filmmaker. Azari confronts broad
  themes of gender, politics, and piety, drawing inspiration from and
  re-interpreting religious icons. While collaborating with Shirin Neshat on a
  wealth of film and video projects, Azari created experimental and art house
  films, including an adaptation of Franz Kafka’s work, K and a series of short
  films, Windows, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. Azari and
  Neshat’s film Women Without Men won the Silver Lion for best director at the
  2009 Venice Film Festival. Azari has since developed a style of “video
  paintings” that combine media to produce a unique three-dimensional effect.
  His work has been exhibited globally and is included in international
  permanent collections.
