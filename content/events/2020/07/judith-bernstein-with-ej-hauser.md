    event_bio: "Since graduating from Yale in 1967, Judith Bernstein has developed a
      reputation as one of the most unwaveringly provocative artists of her
      generation. Steadfast in her cultural, political and social critique for
      over 50 years, Bernstein surged into art world prominence in the early
      1970s with her monumental charcoal drawings of penis-screw hybrids; early
      incarnations of which were exhibited at AIR Gallery; Brooks Jackson Iolas
      Gallery, New York; Brooklyn Museum; and MoMA P.S. 1, among other
      institutions. "

    event_bio: EJ Hauser is a painter who lives and works in Brooklyn. Her paintings
      are both graphic and open to interpretation, teetering between iconography
      and something familiar but abstract. This imagery shifts between
      omnivorous references both ancient and current, her paintings are a
      mysterious talisman, employing buzzing pallets and marks that dance. EJâ€™s
      source library includes potent power objects, which are cross-pollinated
      with formal qualities and care found in domestic craftwork, like rugs,
      fabrics, wallpapers, and mosaics, as well as digital visual
      characteristics, which she interprets through drawing and then
      transliterates onto canvas. Each piece is composed of multiple layers of
      color. The vibrating color connects directly to the energy and aliveness
      of her nature-based subject matter.
