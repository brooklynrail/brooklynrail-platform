short_bio: "**Steve Levine** is a poet and a navigator of the space-time
  continuum, where he has roamed since 1953. His writing is primarily collected
  in _A Blue Tongue, Three Numbers,_ and _Pure Notations_ (Toothpaste Press) and
  _The Cycles of Heaven_ and _To and For_ (Coffee House Press), as well as
  various anthologies and magazines.These days, Levine has been thinking about
  the innate human desire to impose order on chaos, something he has only ever
  been able to achieve in a poem."
