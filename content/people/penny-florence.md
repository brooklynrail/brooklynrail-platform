short_bio: "**Penny Florence** is Professor Emerita at The Slade School of Fine
  Art, UCL and an inter/cross/un/disciplinary artist and writer. She is a
  feminist materialist whose scepticism over “isms” manifests in her theoretical
  writing and in mixed installations including digital, printed and film poetry.
  She performs gallery readings internationally, including e.g. at Tate Modern,
  Tate Britain and LA MoCA. Appointments include: Head of Research Programmes
  (The Slade), leading practice-based Art PhDs; Professor & Director of Research
  at Falmouth University where she established practice-based PhDs; and Chair of
  Humanities and Design Sciences at Art Center, Pasadena, USA. Resisting the
  label “academic”, her work fundamentally explores how forms and processes of
  thinking intersect with art and media."
