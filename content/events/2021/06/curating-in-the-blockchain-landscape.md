Auction houses are curating shows of blockchain art. A museum is set to open a show on June 10th. Galleries are presenting exhibitions of new works. Curators are presenting and reinventing how we understand blockchain art after a whirlwind spring of rollercoaster sales. 

This panel with curators from varying institutions invites us to understand the role curators play, especially as so much blockchain hype is around circumventing 'gatekeepers' and decentralizing the art market. In this liminal moment when blockchain is disrupting many traditionally held concepts in the various art worlds, what role can curators play? How is curating itself changing? In what ways can curators help artists navigate the distributed space of blockchain? What problems are curators noticing and do they want to address how blockchain is entering our art worlds?
