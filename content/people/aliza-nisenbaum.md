short_bio: Born in Mexico City,  **Aliza Nisenbaum**  paints portraits that are
  the manifestation of exchanges with her subjects, taking place over time.
  Distinct social groups are at the foreground of her work, including
  immigrants, dancers, members of grassroot organizations, and subway and health
  workers. She engages with these groups on various levels, sharing resources,
  skills, and ultimately, social representation. Nisenbaum is currently
  finalizing a commission for a joint collaboration with the Queens Museum and
  Delta Air Lines, with a mosaic to be installed at the new Terminal C at
  LaGuardia Airport in 2024. Among other notable solo shows, she exhibited at
  the Tate Liverpool in 2021. She also recently participated in the Gwangju
  Biennale in South Korea (April 2023).
