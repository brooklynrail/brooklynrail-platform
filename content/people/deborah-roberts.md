short_bio: Combining collage with mixed media, **Deborah Roberts’** figurative
  works depict the complexity of Black subjecthood and explore themes of race,
  identity and gender politics. Roberts’ use of collage reflects the challenges
  encountered by young Black children as they strive to build their identity,
  particularly as they respond to preconceived social constructs perpetuated by
  the Black community, the white gaze and visual culture at large. Combining a
  range of different facial features, skin tones, hairstyles and clothes,
  Roberts explains that “with collage, I can create a more expansive and
  inclusive view of the Black cultural experience."  Roberts was born in Austin,
  Texas in 1962 where she continues to live and work.
