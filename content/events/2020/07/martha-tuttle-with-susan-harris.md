    event_bio: Martha Tuttle, a multidisciplinary artist born in Santa Fe, New
      Mexico, has shown her work throughout the U.S. and abroad. Natural
      materials of wool, silk, and dye are worked by hand, each resulting piece
      having undergone an immaterial transfer of energy through Tuttle’s
      physical and meditative touch. The artist’s relationship to materiality is
      revealed further by the inclusion of small “stones,” both actual and cast
      polished metal, and of fabricated steel weights. These elements add
      another layer of visual incident and mark-making, to further open a
      dialogue of possibility and substance, light, and weight. Overall, the
      unification of immaterial energy with material form results in constructed
      canvases and loosely hanging paintings that vibrate with a felt, unseen
      force.
