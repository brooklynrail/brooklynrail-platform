short_bio: "Alexander Nagel is Professor at the Institute of Fine Arts, NYU. His
  interest in art and religious reform produced Michelangelo and the Reform of
  Art (2000, winner of the Renaissance Society of America’s Gordan book prize),
  and The Controversy of Renaissance Art (2011, winner of the College Art
  Association’s Morey book prize). His interest in the multiple temporalities of
  art led to the publication of Anachronic Renaissance (co-authored with
  Christopher Wood, 2010) and Medieval Modern: Art out of Time (2012). His
  current work addresses questions of orientation and configurations of place in
  Renaissance art and culture. In 2016, he received an NEH Fellowship for a
  collaborative project (with Elizabeth Horodowich, NMSU) entitled Amerasia: A
  Renaissance Discovery."
