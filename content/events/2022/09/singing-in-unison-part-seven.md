### *Singing in Unison: Part Seven*

#### In Loving Memory of Jennifer Bartlett (1941–2022)

Rail Curatorial Projects presents the seventh installment of its ongoing exhibition series, Singing in Unison, at Industry City. This series is inspired by an underlying philosophy that runs through American history, which advocates for “the art of joining,” an essential gesture to heal our divided social and political life. Once a postage facility, the popup site measures 16,000 square feet, and has been remodeled to showcase works made by artists young and old, taught and self taught, free from labels. These unique contributions, seen as a democratic vista, represent a symphony of individual creations that celebrates culture for all.
