short_bio: "**Rajni Perera** was born in Sri Lanka in 1985 and lives and works
  in Toronto. She explores issues of hybridity, futurity, ancestorship,
  immigration identity/cultures, monsters and dream worlds. All of these themes
  marry in a newly objectified realm of mythical symbioses. In her work she
  seeks to open and reveal the dynamism of the icons and objects she creates,
  both scripturally existent, self-invented and externally defined. She creates
  a subversive aesthetic that counteracts antiquated, oppressive discourse, and
  acts as a restorative force through which people can move outdated, repressive
  modes of being towards reclaiming their power."
