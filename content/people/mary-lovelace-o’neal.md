short_bio: A dynamic force in American painting since the 1960s,  **Mary
  Lovelace O’Neal**  (b. 1942; Jackson, MS) has developed a singular visual
  language that is acutely personal and profoundly political. Drawing on a broad
  range of influences—from Minimalism to Abstract Expressionism—Lovelace
  O’Neal’s practice is at once worldly, parsing social themes of race and
  gender, and philosophical, fully immersed in conceptual and metaphysical
  investigations of joy, exuberance, nature, and the sublime. The formal
  vitality of Lovelace O’Neal’s practice is inextricable from its social,
  political, and historical urgency, speaking to her experience as a Black woman
  and reflecting her desire to express these experiences in visual language.
