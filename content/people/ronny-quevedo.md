short_bio: "Deeply engaged with notions of identity and the intersection of
  mainstream and historically marginalized cultures, **Ronny Quevedo**
  reenvisions pre- and post-colonial iconographies, offering nuanced
  examinations of personal and social histories. Ronny Quevedo (b.1981)
  incorporates and subverts aspects of abstraction, painting, collage,
  cartography, and sports imagery in a practice spanning installation, drawings,
  and prints. This recuperation of indigenous languages of abstraction, the
  revalorization of their associated labor, and the centering of a living
  connection between contemporary and centuries-old cultural markers remain key
  to Quevedoâ€™s ongoing practice. "
