short_bio: "**reed rushes** is a performance artist living and working in Queens
  NYC. Their performances are committed to the subconscious, using choreography,
  sound, video and installation to explore folklore and myth combined with
  autobiography. Their own drag personas intermingle with ecological research to
  create surprising situations and relations which blur the edges between human
  bodies, affect, technology and objects. **reed rushes** has been commissioned
  by The Yard Theatre London, SPILL Festival National Platform and they've been
  supported by Arts Council England. They hold an MFA from Bard College, and in
  2021 they were a Teaching Fellow at Al-Quds Bard College, Palestine. "
