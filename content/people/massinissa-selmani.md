short_bio: "**Massinissa Selmani** (b. 1980, Algiers) constructs dreamlike
  scenes that mingle documentary images with fictional elements. Generating
  surreal interactions, the works revel in the absurdity of human behaviors.
  Selmani received a Special Mention at the 56th Venice Biennale and has
  participated in the 11th Dakar Biennial (2014), the Sharjah Biennial 13
  (2016), the 13th Biennale de Lyon (2015), and in 2023, the Taipei Biennial. He
  received the Art Collector Prize (2016) and the SAM Art Projects Prize for
  Contemporary Art (2016). In 2023, Selmani was shortlisted for the Marcel
  Duchamp Prize, which included a solo project at the Centre Pompidou. An
  extensive monograph covering the artistâ€™s work was published by Skira in
  2023."
