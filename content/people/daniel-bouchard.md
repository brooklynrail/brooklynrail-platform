short_bio: "**Daniel Bouchard**’s most recent books are _Spider Drop_ (Subpress)
  and _Art & Nature_ (Ugly Duckling Presse). Peter Gizzi said of his work:
  “There’s a love of diction, of words and their histories, of things, and
  things as words; a highly crafted and hammered work artfully deployed.” His
  poems in progress examine received history and scrutinize it as manifested in
  painting, poetry, film, music, and monuments. He is a long distance walker and
  an amateur book restorer. He works in academic publishing."
