short_bio: Collage artist **Bill Miller** has been using vintage linoleum
  flooring as his medium for almost 20 years, and currently lives in Pittsburgh
  PA. Linoleum was the ultimate interior medium, present in all aspects of 20th
  century life from Grandma’s kitchen to the corner drug store and neighborhood
  school. Miller’s innovative work is recognized for pictorial assemblages that
  rely only on the flooring’s found surface, with no added paint, to render his
  subjects. Miller’s images range from bucolic landscapes to surrealistic,
  fiercely political pieces that draw on iconic news and pop culture images that
  have informed society’s common memory. His unexpected use of familiar patterns
  taps into the medium's nostalgic qualities, imparting a sense of personal
  history and rediscovery within each piece.
