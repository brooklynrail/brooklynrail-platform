Founded in October 2000 as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, the Brooklyn Rail exists to support the artist’s journey. It is a gathering place for artists, writers, poets, and people who love the arts.

The Brooklyn Rail journal is an independent publication on arts, culture, and politics, distributed in print for free at community hubs throughout New York City, and online to readers around the world.

The Rail’s 10 monthly issues feature reviews of visual art, music, dance, film, theater, artist books, and literature, alongside political commentary and original fiction and poetry.

Each week, the Rail hosts artist interviews, poetry readings, and cultural conversations out of its Brooklyn headquarters in Industry City.

Together with our community of readers, writers, and artists, we provide a space for independent intellectual inquiry, free thought, and meaningful dialogue. Come visit us in our New Social Environment, daily at 1pm ET!
