  rules-based work exploring notions of aesthetics, politics, and identity
  through intricately layered drawings, photographs, videos, and musical
  compositions. He lives and works in Los Angeles, and is a faculty member at
  California Institute of the Arts. _The American Manifest: Moving Chains,_ is a
  110-foot-long kinetic sculpture, currently on view at Governors Island in New
