short_bio: "**Renee Cox** makes photographs, collages, and installations that
  draw on art history, fashion photography and popular culture. Her work invokes
  a critical vision of female sexuality, beauty, power and heroism through
  nudity, religious imagery and symbolism that inform her interdisciplinary
  process. She is most noted for her larger than life photographs of female
  bodies. She reexaminations the black female figure in the context of
  structures of power. Her work has been included in solo and group exhibitions
  at prominent institutions including Tate Liverpool, The New Museum of
  Contemporary Art (New York, NY), and the Brooklyn Museum. She received the
  Artists Fellowship Award, New York Foundation for the Arts, among other
  recognitions. Cox is an associate professor at Columbia University. "
