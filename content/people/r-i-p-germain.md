short_bio: "**R.I.P. Germain’s** practice traffics in double meanings, deep
  resonances and a tension between accessibility and occlusion. Sedimented with
  layers dense with cultural meaning and reference, the extensive research
  undergirding R.I.P. Germain’s work draws from multiple genres of Black
  experience, history and culture, seeking to make art that is rigorous about
  his commitments and possibilities as a Black artist. R.I.P. Germain has
  exhibited internationally and recent exhibitions include _The Exhibition
  Formerly Known As “Trace Image”_  at Deborah Schamoni, Munich, Germany and
  _Shimmer_, a solo show at Two Queens in Leicester, UK. R.I.P. Germain was the
  recipient of the ICA Image Behaviour 2021 prize, which culminated in his first
  short film  _mew_  premiering at the ICA in 2022."
