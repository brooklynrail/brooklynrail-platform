**About the exhibition:** 

Asian Artists in America is the first installment of a series of virtual exhibitions. Organized independently by curators **Han Hongzheng** and **Chandler Allen**, *Within Global Isolation: Asian Artists in America* brings together work by ten Asian artists across the country, including **Hương Ngô**, Guanyu Xu, **Leonard Suryajaya**, **Ying Zhu**, Siyuan Tan, Zhen Guo, Damien Ding, Tin Wai Wong, Weina Lee, and Toby Zeng. The exhibition is a response to the rise in discrimination towards people of Asian descent, now at its peak as a result of COVID-19. In it, we reassess work relevant to the pandemic, and prompt questions of coexistence — both on the global and local levels.​

The exhibition is virtual, and has a substantial interview component, in which each artist shares their experience with COVID-19 in stories that detail the discrimination they have faced as well as hardships universal to those surviving the pandemic. These extensive interviews allow for contrasting opinions and ideas to unfold through open discussion.

*Within Global Isolation: Asian Artists in America* will be available to view throughout the time of the pandemic.

He was raised as an Indonesian citizen of Chinese descent, and educated as a Buddhist in a Muslin-majority country, Suryajaya uses photography to test the boundaries of intimacy, community, and family. He received his BFA from California State University in 2013, his MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2015, and attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in 2017. Over the last three years, Suryajaya has exhibited at major institutions worldwide, including the Benaki Museum in Athens, Greece (2018); Mana Contemporary in Miami, FL (2018); Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago, IL (2017); and Photoforum Pasquart in Biel, Switzerland (2017).

**Hương Ngo (Ngô Ngọc Hương, 吳玉香)** was born in 1979 in Hong Kong, and often works between France, Vietnam and the US. She is currently based out of Chicago, where she is an Assistant Professor in Contemporary Practices at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Having grown up as a refugee in the American South, she engages histories of colonialism and migration, particularly in relationship to language, structures of power, and ideologies. The body and, alternately, its absence and its traces are strongly present in her work, which often asks how we might make visible the process of our own subject formation. She earned her BFA at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2001, her MFA at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2004 and completed the Whitney Independent Study Program in 2012. In 2016, she was awarded the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Grant in Vietnam to realize a project, begun at the Archives Nationales d’Outre-Mer in France, recently exhibited at DePaul Art Museum (2017), and continued through the Camargo Core Program (2018), that examines the colonial history of surveillance in Vietnam and the anti-colonial strategies of resistance vis-à-vis the activities of female organizers and liaisons. Her work has been exhibited worldwide at the MoMA, MCA Chicago, Nhà Sàn Collective, and Para Site, and supported by 3Arts, Chicago Artists Coalition, DCASE, and Sàn Art, among others.
