short_bio: Artist **vanessa german** works across sculpture, performance,
  communal rituals, installation, and photography. Considered inextricable from
  her identity as an activist, germanâ€™s autodidactic artmaking has its lineage
  in indigenous and West African folk practices as well as Black Arts movements
  from the 1960s onwards to propose new models for social healing, utilizing
  creativity and tenderness as forces to reckon with the historical and ongoing
  catastrophes of white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, and misogynoir. As she
  re-appropriates, re-conceptualizes, and resiliently transforms both her
  materials and the symbolic weight of her images, she occasions a
  transfiguration analogous to healing.
