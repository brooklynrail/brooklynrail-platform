short_bio: A painter whose compositions address the continuity of movement,
  climate change, infrastructure, and architecture, **Torkwase Dyson** grapples
  with ways space is perceived and negotiated by black and brown bodies. These
  subjects produce abstractions that explore the history and future of black
  spatial liberation strategies and environmental racism. Explorations of how
  the body unifies, balances, and arranges itself to move through environments
  become expressive and discursive structures within her work. Dyson builds the
  paintings slowly, accumulating washes and configuring geometric elements
  through improvisation and reflection. The subtle use of atmospheric color,
  lines, and scale in the paintings invites the eye to consider the conceptual
  and corporeal knowledge of space in real time.
