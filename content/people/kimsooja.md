short_bio: "Throughout the past forty years, **Kimsooja’s** conceptual practice
  has been dedicated to exploring the human condition through the awareness of
  self and others in search for a comprehensive totality. Her diverse practice
  combines performance, film, sculpture, photography, and site-specific
  installation using textiles, light, and sound to create a transcendent
  experience for the viewer. Rooted in the practice of sewing, Kimsooja's
  seminal work _A Needle Woman_, positions her body as a symbolic needle, a
  motionless figure in the center of urban environments passing through the
  fabric of a place and its people. Metaphorically referring to the way the
  moving body weaves connections with new contexts and new situations, this
  concept reoccurs throughout Kimsooja’s practice. "
