short_bio: Born in 1990, **Marcus Jahmal**  lives and works in New York. He was
  raised in Brooklynâ€™s Prospect Heights neighborhood, growing up in a family
  with roots in the West Indies and American south. His paintings synthesize a
  range of inspirations, drawing from photographs, ancient rituals, and personal
  memories. Developing his compositions directly upon the surface of each
  canvas, Jahmal coaxes imaginary, yet uncannily familiar scenes, exploring
  dreams and folkloric Americana, and the realities of gentrification and city
  dwelling. Jahmal has exhibited widely in the United States, Europe, and Asia.
  His inaugural monograph, _Solid Ghosts_,was published in 2018, and he has a
  recent solo exhibition at the Passerelle Centre d'art contemporain, in Brest,
  France.
