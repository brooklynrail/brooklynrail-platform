  Bulls is Oglala Lakota and Northern Cheyenne from Lame Deer, Montana. She has
  experience as an organizer and on the frontlines of local, national and
  transnational campaigns for social, racial and environmental justice.
  Krystal’s identity as a Native American veteran is central to her organizing
  and storytelling. At the heart of Krystal’s work are the connections between
  collective wellness, environmental justice, Indigenous Peoples’ Rights, and
  anti-militarism. In healing from her experience as a soldier, Krystal has
  dedicated herself to embodying the essential quality of a warrior: a
  commitment to the well-being of not only her People and their relationship to
  the land, but that of all Peoples. "
