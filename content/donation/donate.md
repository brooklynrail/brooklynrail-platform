Since 2000, the Rail has been dedicated to building community and fostering a free and independent platform for artists of all kinds. 2020 marks the Railâ€™s 20th anniversary, and we are extending this celebration into 2021. But as a small non-profit, we need your help. Please consider making a donation today: your contribution will directly support contributing writers, guest artists, and production staff in this unprecedented time.

The Rail also now hosts The New Social Environment: Lunchtime Conversations with The Brooklyn Rail, an online programming series. Each day at 1pm we gather as a community for conversations about creative life and artistic expression in our new reality.

Our journal and programming will remain free and independent. But as a small non-profit, we need your help. Please consider making a donation today: your contribution will directly support contributing writers, guest artists, and production staff in this unprecedented time.
