short_bio: Stockholm-based publishing house **Praun & Guermouche** was
  established in 2020 by graphic designer Sandra Praun and artist Oscar
  Guermouche, which focuses on art, photography, theory, essays, and artists’
  books. The core of their collaboration is the translation of artistic œuvres,
  projects, or individual artworks into book form. P & G believe that the way
  books convey art has intrinsic value, and accordingly the books they produce
  both reflect and complement the art.
