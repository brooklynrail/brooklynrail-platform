  originally from Seattle, Washington. Her work has been published in _Perennial
  Press, Popshot Magazine_, and _Allegory Ridges’_ poetry anthology Aurora. She
  is a deeply invigorated storyteller who delves into themes such as identity,
  equity, overcoming trauma, accepting your wild and learning to listen to your
  intuition. Lyn is specifically inspired to write about black diaspora,
  ancestors, and those who have been historically and politically marginalized
  in our society, as a means of empowering future generations with their
  stories. "
