short_bio: "**Yique's** research runs through classical Marxism, the Frankfurt
  School's critique of society, and the social transformations of neoliberalism.
  Yique's work and curated exhibitions have been shown in a variety of countries
  and spaces including TATE Modern, OXO Tower, Cromwell Place, KL8 Brussels,
  Fluxus Museum in Greece, Ming Contemporary Art Museum in Shanghai, Baolong Art
  Centre in Hangzhou, amongst others. He has been featured in the _BBC, The
  Guardian, The New York Times, CNN, Reuters,_ and many other media.
  Unapologetically self-identifying as both a critic and a \"troublemaker,\"
  Yique unceasingly challenges conventions, pushing the boundaries of artistic
  and intellectual discourse."
