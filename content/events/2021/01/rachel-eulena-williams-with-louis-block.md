    event_bio: Since the mid-1980s, Tishan Hsu’s prescient artistic practice has
      been probing the cognitive as well as physical affects of transformative
      technological advances on our lives. Through the use of unusual materials,
      software tools, and innovative fabrication techniques, his enigmatic
      paintings and sculptures explore and manifest poetic new ways to engage
      and reimagine the interface between an organic body and
      technology.   Since the late-1980s and 90s, Hsu has been making the
      majority of his paintings on canvas using a silkscreen process to fuse
      images from scanned pastel drawings of organic skin with appropriated
      biomedical images, and other parts of human, animal and technological
      bodies. The scale of these works is such that the dot matrix of the
      silkscreen is markedly legible, conveying an affect of the digital.  In
      the early 2000s, Hsu explored the use of digital printing on canvas as
      well as interactive installations using video processed projections with
      motion-sensor technology activated by the body.    His most recent
      paintings, further, almost announce their techno-mediation through an
      evident digital reproducibility fused with the material affect of
      pigmented medium.  Various re-engaged motifs from his visual vocabulary
      are now warped and morphing into hardware and screens and become part of a
      larger corporeal entity.
