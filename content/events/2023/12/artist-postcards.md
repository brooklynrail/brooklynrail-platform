An Arm & A Leg presents the first videos from their artist *Postcard* series. Far from exhaustive profiles, these videos are snapshots of the lives and practices of artists in major cities. The goal is to whet viewers’ appetites and sizzle in their minds, encouraging them to learn more.

Joel Baca’s work is an exploration of personal nostalgia and cultural iconography, a deliberate interplay between abstract shapes, gestural marks, and figurative motifs.

Annabel Daou’s work takes form in paper-based constructions, sound, performance, and video. Daou suspends, carves out or records the language of daily life.

Stefan Bondell is a New York painter and poet. He makes modern day  history paintings that create a dialogue between antiquity and contemporary issues.
