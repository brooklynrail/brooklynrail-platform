short_bio: Few artists have shaped the scope of contemporary art and influenced
  a younger generation more than **Wolfgang Tillmans.** Since the early 1990s,
  his works have epitomized a new kind of subjectivity in photography, pairing
  intimacy and playfulness with social critique and the persistent questioning
  of existing values and hierarchies. Through his seamless integration of
  genres, subjects, techniques, and exhibition strategies, he has expanded
  conventional ways of approaching the medium and his practice continues to
  address the fundamental question of what it means to create pictures in an
  increasingly image-saturated world.
