short_bio: Born to a Dutch mother and Filipino father,  **Martha Atienza**  (b.
  1981, Manila, Philippines) has moved between the Netherlands and the
  Philippines throughout her life, which has had a profound influence on her
  focus as an artist. Atienza's practice explores installation and video as a
  way of documenting and questioning issues around environment, community and
  development. Her work is mostly constructed in video, of an almost
  sociological nature, and tends to be collaborative, working with people from
  different backgrounds as well as residents of Bantayan Island, whose
  narratives are woven into issues such as environmental change and
  displacement. She recently was awarded the Ateneo Arts Award with studio
  Residency Grants in Liverpool, Melbourne, New York and Singapore.
