last_name: Kanwar
short_bio: "**Amar Kanwar** was born in 1964 in New Delhi, India, where he
  currently lives and works. Kanwar’s work traces the legacy of globalization
  and decolonization, land use and border rights, environmental concerns, human
  rights and free expression, and sexual violence. Interwoven throughout these
  inquiries are disparate narrative structures which ground his philosophical
  investigations. Through hybrid installations which incorporate images,
  literature, poetry and music, Kanwar creates meditative works that do not aim
  to represent trauma, but to find ways through them. Kanwar’s work has been
  exhibited in solo exhibitions internationally, and he has been the recipient
  of several awards including an Honorable Mention at the Sharjah Biennial 2023,
  the IHME Helsinki Commission (2022), and others."
