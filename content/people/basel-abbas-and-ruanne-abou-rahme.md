short_bio: "**Basel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme** work together across a range
  of sound, image, text, installation and performance practices. Their practice
  is engaged in the intersections between performativity, political imaginaries,
  the body and virtuality. Largely their approach has been one of sampling
  materials both existing and self-authored in the form of sound, image, text,
  objects and recasting them into altogether new ‘scripts’. The result is a
  practice that investigates the political, visceral, material possibilities of
  sound, image, text and site, taking on the form of multi-media installations
  and live sound/image performances."
