short_bio: "**Kenny Rivero’s** work, which spans paintings, collage, drawings,
  and sculpture, explores the complexity of identity through narrative images,
  language, and symbolism. His process allows him to explore what he perceives
  as the broken narrative of Dominican-American identity, socio-geographic
  solidarity, familial expectations, race, and gender roles. Rivero cites the
  hybrid qualities of salsa, hip-hop, house music, jazz, and merengue—as well as
  Vodun and Santeria, which were present in his daily life growing up—as core
  influences on his decision-making in the studio. He is the recipient of
  numerous residencies and awards including Joan Mitchell Foundation Painters &
  Sculptors Grant (2018) and Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture
  Residency, Skowhegan, ME (2017); among others. "
