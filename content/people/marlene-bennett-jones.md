short_bio: "**Marlene Bennett Jones** (b.1947) is the daughter of Agatha P.
  Bennett and grand-daughter of Delia Bennett. Like most young girls growing up
  in Gee’s Bend, Alabama, Marlene learned to pieces and quilt from her mother
  and other female relatives in the community. After many years working in the
  electronics industry for LockheedMartin and Raytheon as an electronic
  technician, Marlene returned to making and quilting when her mother became ill
  in the early 2000’s. When both parents passed, Marlene used all of their
  clothes to make over 20 heirlooms quilts for her siblings and family members.
  Marlene is one the oldest Gee’s Bend quilters to continue piecing and and
  quilting quilts. Her quilts has been featured in museums, art galleries, and
  fashion runways both in the U.S. and Europe."
