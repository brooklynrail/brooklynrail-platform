**Hettie Jones** is an American poet. She has written 23 books that include a memoir of the Beat Generation, three volumes of poetry, and publications for children and young adults, including *The Trees Stand Shining* and *Big Star Fallin' Mama: Five Women in Black Music*.

Jones is a longtime editor and has taught poetry, fiction, and memoir at many universities, including Penn State University, NYU, the 92nd Street Y, University of Wyoming, and Parsons School of Design. Jones is a former chair of the PEN Prison Writing Committee, and from 1989 to 2002 she ran a writing workshop at the New York State Correctional Facility for Women at Bedford Hills, which included inmate Judy Clark as a student. This workshop hailed as inspiration for Jonesâ€™s nationally distributed collection, *Aliens At The Border*. Jones also co-authored a memoir for Rita Marley, widow of Bob Marley. More recently, Jones has received grants to begin a writing program on Manhattan's Lower East Side at the Lower East Side Girls Club Center for Community. Her book, *Love, H*, a selection from 40 years of correspondence with the sculptor Helene Dorn, was published by Duke University Press in October 2016.

**Bob Holman** is a contributor of the *Rail*. Among his contributions are:
