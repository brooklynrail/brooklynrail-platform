short_bio: "Writer, editor, artist, and interviewer **Thyrza Nichols Goodeve**
  writes “with” rather than “on” contemporary art and artists. Her interests
  range across art as a “structure of feeling,” human/nonhuman animal
  ontologies, the aesthetics of wonder, the interview as essay, surrealist
  methodologies, and the metaphysics of technology. She has published widely on
  artists such as Ellen Gallagher, Tom Friedman, Hadieh Shafie, Joan Waltemath,
  among many others. She is the author of _How Like A Leaf: A Conversation with
  Donna Haraway_ (1999) and is compiling her collected writings, _No Wound Ever
  Speaks for Itself: Writing, Art, Vulnerability, Conversation, Attitude_ with a
  preface by Avital Ronell. She was Senior Art Editor at the _Rail_ from 2017 to
  2019 and is currently an Editor-at-Large."
