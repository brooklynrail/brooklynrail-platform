short_bio: Born in Brooklyn (1996), **Louis Osmosis** is an interdisciplinary
  artist working primarily in sculpture, drawing, and performance. His practice
  revolves heavily around craft, performative actions, and readymades,
  incorporating found objects and vernacular materials, from popsicle sticks to
  toilet paper tubes, and hornet nests to wood altered by beavers. Equally
  invested in postmodern bleakness and artistic production, Osmosis’s
  speculative approach to form reflects his ongoing “investigation into modes of
  aspiration and lack.” He received his BFA from the Cooper Union in 2018.
