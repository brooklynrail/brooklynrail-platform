short_bio: "**American Artist** is an interdisciplinary artist whose work
  considers Black labor and visibility, as well as anti-blackness within
  networked life and digital systems. Their work includes video, installation,
  new media, and writing, and their legal name change to American Artist serves
  as an ambivalent foundation for their practice. It insists on blackness as
  descriptive of an American artist, and at the same time erases identity in
  virtual spaces where “American Artist” is an anonymous name, unable to be
  googled or validated by a computer as a person’s name."
