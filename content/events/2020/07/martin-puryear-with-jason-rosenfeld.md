    event_bio: Over the last five decades Martin Puryear has created a body of work
      based on abstract organic forms rich with psychological, cultural, and
      historical references. His labor-intensive sculptures are made by hand at
      his studio in upstate New York. They combine practices adapted from many
      different traditions, including wood carving, joinery, and boat building,
      as well as more recent technology. As a student, Puryear studied
      ornithology, falconry, and archery, and in the 1960s he volunteered with
      the Peace Corps in west Africa, where he educated himself in the region’s
      indigenous crafts. Since then he has continued to travel extensively,
      observing a range of cultures and their unique approaches to object
      making.
