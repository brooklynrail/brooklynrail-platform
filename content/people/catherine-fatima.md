  Toronto. Her first book _Sludge Utopia_ was published by Book*hug Press in
  2018, and was reviewed by _The Literary Review of Canada_ and _The White Wall
  Review_. You might enjoy it if you are interested in sex, depression, fitness
  of the self for life under the hell of capitalism, young adulthood, a bit too
  much continental philosophy for a novel, latent Catholicism, some drug use,
  friendship, family, and love. It's a work of autofiction.
