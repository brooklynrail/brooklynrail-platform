  and rules-based work that explores the notions of aesthetics, politics, and
  identity through the medium of intricate layered drawings, photographs,
  videos, and musical compositions. He lives and works in Los Angeles,
  California and is a faculty member at California Institute of the Arts. His
  most recent exhibition _The American Manifest: Moving Chains,_ a 110-foot-long

  The public art sculpture addresses the reality of systematic racism in America
  by utilizing steel chains and sustainably harvested African Mahogany. "
