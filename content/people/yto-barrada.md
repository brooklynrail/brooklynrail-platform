short_bio: Yto Barrada’s installations reinterpret social relationships, uncover
  subaltern histories, and reveal the prevalence of fiction in institutionalized
  narratives. Barrada arrived at her artist practice through studies of history
  and political science, particularly in the negotiation of political and
  personal experiences. Informed by postcolonial thought and socio-political
  concerns, Barrada’s interests range from the tensions around borders,
  immigration, and tourism to the urban landscape, and from children’s toys to
  botany and paleontology. Her practice encompasses photography, film,
  sculpture, painting, printmaking, and publishing, while her installations are
  often comprised of both original work and found objects.
