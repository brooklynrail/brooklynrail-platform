    event_bio: Xaviera Simmons’s body of work spans photography, performance, video,
      sound, sculpture and installation. She defines her studio practice, which
      is rooted in an ongoing investigation of experience, memory, abstraction,
      present and future histories-specifically shifting notions surrounding
      landscape-as cyclical rather than linear. In other words, Simmons is
      committed equally to the examination of different artistic modes and
      processes; for example, she may dedicate part of a year to photography,
      another part to performance, and other parts to installation, video, and
      sound works-keeping her practice in constant and consistent rotation,
      shift, and engagement.
