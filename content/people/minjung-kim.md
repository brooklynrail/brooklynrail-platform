short_bio: "**Minjung Kim** is a contemporary Korean artist best known for her
  ink paintings by their transparency as well as her subtle formal compositions
  on layered paper. Committed to re-interpreting traditional Korean aesthetics,
  Kim employs a process-based organization of her thoughts, problems, and whims
  in each of her artworks. Through the repetitive work of burning and layering
  mulberry Hanji paper, she conveys the process of emotional healing and
  meditation. Kim was born in 1962 in Gwangju, Republic of Korea. "
