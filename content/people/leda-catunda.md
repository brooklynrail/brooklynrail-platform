short_bio: "Since the 1980s, **Leda Catunda** has constructed a visual lexicon
  shifting between mass culture and craftwork, employing abstract painting and
  sculpture as much as pop art’s collage and appropriation procedures. With the
  means at hand and conserving the traces of her process, Catunda’s “soft world”
  insinuates a critique of the affirmation of identity through consumerism,
  reworking textile waste and the mechanisms of commercial culture. In her
  career she has participated in three São Paulo Biennials (1983, 1985 and 1994)
  and large collective exhibitions such as Modernity (Paris, 1987), Latin
  American Artists of the 20th Century (Museum of Modern Art in New York, 1993),
  and elsewhere. "
