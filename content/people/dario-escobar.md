short_bio: Guatemalan-born sculptor **Darío Escobar** is a contemporary artist
  whose work is characterized by the formal and conceptual investigation of
  objects and their insertion into the field of art history and visual art. His
  work challenges the viewer  us reflect on the space we occupy within the
  social, political, and economic systems that sustain our existence. Since the
  late 1990s, he has utilized a wide range of industrial and everyday consumer
  products, from cereal boxes to car bumpers, to construct an ongoing dialogue
  on global consumerism. That dialogue, invariably, has also incorporated an
  extensive conversation with object - making across the ages. Over the last two
  decades, Escobar's art has gained a critical place around the world.
