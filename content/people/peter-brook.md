short_bio: "**Peter Brook** (1925-2022) distinguished himself in theater, opera,
  cinema, and writing throughout his career. He directed his first play in
  London in 1943 and has since directed more than 70 productions in London,
  Paris, and New York. In 1971, he co-founded the International Centre for
  Theatre Research in Paris and opened its permanent base in the Bouffes du Nord
  Theatre in 1974. Brook’s longstanding relationship to the Brooklyn Academy of
  Music, where many of his productions have been seen in New York, dates back to
  the 1970s, when BAM presented his innovative rendering of _A Midsummer Night's
  Dream_ with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Brook’s autobiography, _Threads of
  Time_, was published in 1998. "
