# The Brooklyn Rail
https://brooklynrail.org


## Install

1. [Install Hugo.](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-1-install-hugo)
1. Start the server.

   ```sh
   hugo server
   ```

## Accessibility testing
We are using **Pa11y CI** (https://pa11y.org/) a command-line tool that is used during automated testing to highlight potential accessibility issues and prevent problematic code from being pushed live. https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci

### Getting started

Install pa11y locally by running
```
npm install -g pa11y-ci
```

## Importing content

The repository already contains a subset of the articles under `content/`, but if you want modify [the import script](import.js) to bring in more data:

1. Install Node.js.
1. Start the database from [the main site](https://github.com/brooklynrail/brooklynrail) directory.

   ```sh
   docker-compose up db
   ```

1. From this directory, run the import.

   ```sh
   npm install
   node import.js
   ```

You should see directories and files written under `content/`.
