short_bio: "**Ridley Howard** makes paintings that blend vastly different visual
  languages, among them American Scene Painting, Italian Renaissance, Pop Art
  and Geometric Abstraction. Subtle and deceptively straightforward, the
  paintings invoke a sense of monumentality while retaining a lingering intimacy
  and stillness. He earned his MFA from the School of the Museum of Fine  Arts,
  Boston, in 1999 and attended  the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture
  in 2000. He has recently shown at  Marinaro Gallery, NY; Andr√©hn-Schiptjenko,
  Paris; and elsewhere. His work has been exhibited at numerous institutions,
  including The American Academy of Arts and Letters, New York; Museum of Fine
  Arts, Boston; High Museum of  Art, Atlanta; among others. He lives and works
  between Athens, Georgia and Brooklyn, NY."
