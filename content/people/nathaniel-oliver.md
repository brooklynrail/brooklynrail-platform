short_bio: "**Nathaniel Oliver** imbues the tradition of Black figurative
  painting with magical realism. Staged vignettes rife with symbolism, their
  landscapes are inhabited by figures, in Oliver’s words, “grappling with their
  varied situations as Black adventurers”—fishing, running, swimming, on the
  lookout for threats both worldly and otherworldly, moving through portals to
  hidden dimensions. These characters explore faraway lands that exist somewhere
  between imagination and reality, occupying scenes that blend elements of the
  artist’s everyday life with a dizzying array of objects, creatures, and plants
  from around the world. Inspired by Black art history, speculative science
  fiction, and cosmic jazz, Oliver layers references into elaborate narratives
  writ large in oil. "
