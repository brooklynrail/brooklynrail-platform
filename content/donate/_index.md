Over the past 21 years the _[Brooklyn Rail](https://brooklynrail.org/)_ has undertaken a miraculous journey, bringing together in a single monthly publication art, music, dance, film, theater, and literature, along with thoughtful social and political meditations. 

In addition to publishing one of New York’s last free newspapers, the _Rail_ reached 3 million readers online in 2021, and hosted over [260 lunchtime New Social Environment conversations](https://brooklynrail.org/events), permanently [available in our archive](https://brooklynrail.org/events). This expansion has enabled us to elevate the voices and contributions of many more people than ever before.
