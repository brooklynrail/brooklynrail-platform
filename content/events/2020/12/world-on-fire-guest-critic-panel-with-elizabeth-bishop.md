Please join us for a conversation emerging out of the Brooklyn Rail's September Guest Critics Page "[World on Fire](https://brooklynrail.org/2020/9/criticspage)."

> This collection of writing and art is a defense against the violence in our lives, an affirmation of life under the constant threat of erasure. Radical empathy. Stomp traces of fascism with precise intent. Culture jamming. Disruptors on the side of reimagined justice. The orchestration of crashing bricks. How it feels to survive being human in the midst of neverbeforeseen crisis such as we are living through right now. These pages bear witness as they break open words and images to make space for our bodies and lives. Kintsugi, golden joinery. What does it mean to repair? Compassionate urgency. Unlearning. Distance and perception. To be still in the still of the crisis. Biopower recaptured. The politics of survival is insufficient for the moment. — Dr. Elizabeth Bishop
