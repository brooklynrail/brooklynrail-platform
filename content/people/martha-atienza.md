short_bio: "Born to a Dutch mother and Filipino father,  **Martha Atienza**  (b.
  1981, Manila, Philippines) has moved between the Netherlands and the
  Philippines throughout her life, which has had a profound influence on her
  focus as an artist. Atienza's practice explores installation and video as a
  way of documenting and questioning issues around environment, community and
  development. Her work is mostly constructed in video, of an almost
  sociological nature, and tends to be collaborative. Atienza is a co-founder of
  the NGO GOODland: an organization that collaborates to create case-specific
  solutions that free land & oceans from harmful substances whilst enabling more
  eco-friendly means of living for the local islanders."
