short_bio: NY-based artist **Fawn Krieger** examines themes of touch, ownership
  and exchange in her multi-genre works. Her Flintstonian tactility and penchant
  for scale compressions reveal an unlikely collision of private and public,
  where intimate moments also serve as social ruptures. Her work has been
  exhibited at The Kitchen, Art in General, and many other galleries. Krieger is
  a 2019 Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award Fellow, and has received many
  additional grants. She serves as Program Director at The Keith Haring
  Foundation, Consultant for the Berlin-based MFA & PhD program Transart
  Institute, and Adjunct Faculty at Adelphi University and Watkins College of
  Art. Krieger has upcoming residencies at the new Kai Art Center and the Josef
  & Anni Albers Foundation.
