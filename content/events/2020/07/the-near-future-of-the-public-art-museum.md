  - person: mary-abbe-hintz
    event_bio: Mary Abbe Hintz has been writing about art and cultural affairs since
      1977. During her 32 year tenure as art critic and art news reporter at the
      Minneapolis Star Tribune, she wrote stories, profiled Minnesota artists
      and museum staff, reviewed exhibitions, analyzed national cultural
      politics and finance, and penned stories inspired by art-themed travel in
      Europe. An advocate of snappy ledes and jargon-free lingo, she remains
      confident that, no matter how esoteric art may sometimes appear, it will
      interest anyone if the writing about it is engaging and informative.
      Topics she’s written about include royal treasures, Congressional culture
      wars, Chinese tomb sculpture, civil rights photos, graffiti, American
      Indian paintings and pottery, manga, 3-D printed sculpture, Charles Schulz
      cartoons, Japanese ceramics, Korean furniture, custom-made guns, Hmong
      textiles, Italian couture, Renaissance bronzes, restitution of Nazi-era
      stolen art, paintings and drawings of every era, practitioners of “erotic
      torture,” and poop-in-art.
