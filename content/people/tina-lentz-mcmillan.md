short_bio: "**Tina Lentz-McMillan** is a Filipina/-American/Mestiza poet whose
  poetry centers mixed identity. Her current work focuses on how this identity
  can be othering from both sides and interrogates how colonialism can manifest
  as intergenerational trauma. Symbols manifest, recur, and change across her
  body of work to engage the reader in mythmaking. She is an MFA candidate at
  Queens University of Charlotte and currently lives in the lands of the Tohono
  O’odham and Pascua Yaqui Tribe, also known as Tucson, Arizona, with her
  partner and their dog and cat. Next creative steps are exploring a borderless
  poetic. "
