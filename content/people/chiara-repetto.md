short_bio: "**Chiara Repetto** co-owns Kaufmann Repetto, a contemporary art
  gallery based in both Milan and New York, alongside her sister Francesca
  Kaufmann. The gallery is one of the founding members of The Campus, an
  abandoned school building from the 1950's in Upstate New York which was
  recently repurposed into a contemporary art exhibition space. Chiara received
  her Bachelor's degree in Italian Contemporary Literature and a Master's in
  Publishing, and worked as a freelance writer as well as in a literary agency
  in Milan, all before joining Francesca Kaufmann Gallery in 2005. In 2013,
  Chiara moved to New York to open Kaufmann Repettoâ€™s American outpost and
  second space in Chelsea. The gallery now proudly resides in Tribeca. "
