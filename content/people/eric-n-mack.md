short_bio: "Using fabric and other found objects, **Eric N. Mack** (b. 1987,
  Columbia, MD) creates richly textured compositions that collapse the
  boundaries between fine art, fashion, and architecture. The artist identifies
  as a painter working in the medium of fabric, although his works frequently
  move away from the walls to synthesize painting with sculpture. He received
  his BFA from The Cooper Union and his MFA from Yale University. In 2017, Mack
  was the recipient of the inaugural BALTIC Artists’ Award selected by artist
  Lorna Simpson. He has participated in numerous residencies, solo exhibitions
  and group exhibitions internationally and Mack’s work is in the permanent
  collections of Albright-Knox Art Gallery, The Studio Museum in Harlem and the
  Whitney. Mack lives and works in New York. "
