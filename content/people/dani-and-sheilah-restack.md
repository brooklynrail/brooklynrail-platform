name: Dani and Sheilah ReStack
first_name: Dani and Sheilah
last_name: ReStack
short_bio: As written by Michael Sicinski, Cinema Scope, **Dani and Sheilah
  ReStack** have embarked on an artistic relationship that is formally and
  emotionally adjacent to their domestic lives, a quotidian zone they share with
  their young daughter Rose. Both artists have established careers on their own.
  Neither Dani’s video work or Sheilah’s multimedia performance and installation
  work could exactly prepare us for the force of the women’s collaborative
  efforts. ReStack collaborations have shown at the 2017 Whitney Biennial,
  Iceberg Projects Chicago, Toronto International Film Festival, and others.
  They have received grants from the Canada Council for the Arts and Ohio Arts
  Council. They have been residents at The Headlands Center for the Arts,
  MacDowell and Visual Studies Workshop.
