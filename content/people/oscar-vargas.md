short_bio: "**Oscar Vargas** is a Mexican-American writer based in Bushwick,
  Brooklyn, where he has lived his whole life. He completed his MFA in Poetry at
  Brooklyn College in 2019. Currently, he is working as a part-time Adjunct
  Instructor and full-time corporate digital marketer. His poetry reflects the
  experiences gained by traveling back and forth to Mexico in his childhood and
  growing up in a gentrifying Bushwick. His works are products of conflicting
  binaries and are attempts at a reconciliation that is a little more than
  acceptance but a little less than forgiveness."
