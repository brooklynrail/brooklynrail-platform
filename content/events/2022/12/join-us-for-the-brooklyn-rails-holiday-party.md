Ear Yoga is an improvisational music ensemble that celebrates unity through the experience of listening. The goal of the project is to provide a rotating cast of creatives freedom and safety to generate spontaneous composition with the understanding that the best movements write themselves. Unhindered by genre, Ear Yoga incorporates natural elements and explores all the possibilities that music presents. Saturday’s lineup features Adam Turay (bass), Becky Foinchas (vocals, percussion), Bobbie Johnston (keys), Dan Drohan (drums), Élan (vocals), Raven (alto sax), Ryan Easter (trumpet), and Susana Plotts-Pineda (poetry, cello). Close your eyes, which way to go? Just use your ears, and you will know!

We’ll have refreshments from Two Robbers Hard Seltzer, Hiatus Tequila, Five Boroughs Brewery, Fort Hamilton Distillery, and Moore Brothers Wine Co. Vegan catering to be provided by NYC Events Pro. The party kicks off at 5 pm at Singing in Unison, Part Seven in Industry City. Join us there!
