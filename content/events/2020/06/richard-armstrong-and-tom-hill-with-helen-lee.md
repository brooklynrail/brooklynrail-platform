**Helen Lee** has had many roles in the art world, including collector, academic, art advisor, art book editor and auction house specialist. She has worked at Christie’s, Harry N. Abrams Publishing, the Robert Miller Gallery, and for James Wolfensohn, among others. Her passion for the arts derives from her belief that art and culture provide vital means of communication across cultural and political divides. All art forms, whether through music, theater, dance, poetry or literature, help us to make sense of the world and current events and can clarify how best to move forward. Art has the power to be eternal and has the unique ability to challenge and enrich our lives daily. Helen is an advisor to the Milken Institute for their art and culture programming. She is the Chairman of the American Foundation for the Courtauld Institute or Art, where she completed her post-graduate studies.

Helen is also a board member of the Brooklyn Rail.

His poems and prose have recently appeared in Art in America, Open Space, Fanzine, Art Practical, New American Writing, The Poetry Project Newsletter, and Best American Experimental Writing. In 2015, he won a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, and in 2018 was awarded the inaugural Toni Beauchamp Prize in Critical Art Writing. He is an editor at Krupskaya and occasionally publishes small press materials under the imprint OMG! His newest full-length book is The Four Seasons (Wonder, 2018). He lives in El Cerrito, California.
