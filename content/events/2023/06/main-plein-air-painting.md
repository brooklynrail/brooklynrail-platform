Paint in the beautiful Acadia National Park in Maine. During this extended Art Students League of New York workshop, instructor Frank Webster and students will stay in scenic Bar Harbor — one of the most picturesque locations on the East Coast — and take daily excursions into the park to capture the landscape in your media of choice. 

Admire the pink-granite cliffs, blue skies, and white surf that make Acadia a plein air painter's paradise. This workshop will focus on direct observation of the landscape with special attention to capturing effects of atmosphere and light. Daily instruction, demonstrations, and hands-on guidance will help you develop a mastery of technique by documenting the wonder of the first national park created east of the Mississippi. 

Between sessions, students will be able to explore the thriving gallery scene in Bar Harbor and sample the culinary highlights of Maine, which is world-famous for its rich regional cuisine. You will not want to miss this extraordinary opportunity.\
