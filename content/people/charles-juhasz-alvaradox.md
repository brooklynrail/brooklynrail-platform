short_bio: "**Charles Juhasz-Alvarado** is a creator of mixed-media sculptural
  artist, architect, and teacher. He has shown his work in numerous solo and
  group exhibitions and at events inside and outside Puerto Rico, including the
  Sao Paulo Biennial, Art Basel Miami,  and ARCO. He has received academic
  fellowships such as the Phillip Morris Fellowship for Graduate Studies at Yale
  (1992â€“93) and a number of grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. His
  installations, sometimes interactive, involve subjects such as cultural
  hybridization, identity, and the relations of power between cultures in a time
  of globalization, and provoke viewers not only to be participants as they
  interact with the pieces but also to look beyond their experience with the
  work."
