short_bio: Kambui Olujimi was born and raised in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.
  He received his MFA from Columbia University School of the Arts and is a
  graduate of Parson's School of Design and the Skowhegan School of Painting and
  Sculpture. Olujimi works within the realm of ideas rather than within an
  exclusive medium. Although he has directed a great deal of work in film, his
  is truly a multi-media practice. He crafts potent social commentary from
  delicate wisps of myth and whimsy mixed with real-world narrative. Lyrical and
  elliptical rather than ideological, Olujimi’s art transcends the political
  sphere, affirming its own autonomy.
