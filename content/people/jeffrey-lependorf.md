short_bio: "**Jeffrey Lependorf,** Executive Director of The Flow Chart
  Foundation, formerly served as Executive Director of Small Press Distribution
  and the Community of Literary Magazines and Presses, and currently also
  directs the Art Omi: Music international musicians residency, a program that
  he created for musicians from around the globe to collaborate with one
  another. A composer/musician, he is a master player of the shakuhachi Japanese
  bamboo flute, and his music has been performed around the globe—literally, in
  fact: a recording of his “Night Pond” was launched into space when the shuttle
  Atlantis took off on May 15, 1997 and remained for a year aboard the Mir space
  station."
