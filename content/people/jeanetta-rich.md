short_bio: "**Jeanetta Rich**, poet and filmmaker, holds a mirror to desperation
  so that you can see yourself. Her work is part social critique and screwball
  scripture. Hailing from Los Angeles by way of whoredom, she writes about the
  emotional lives of voiceless women, those who have been silenced through
  poverty and/or lack of education. By exposing the brain fucking women are
  subjected in our \"waste culture\" she calls for a need to switch off selfie
  mode and pull a community of women into focus, that otherwise would be
  ignored. Her work was included in _Texte Zur Kunst_'s 30th anniversary issue
  \"The Feminist\" and _The Quarterless Review_, . She is writer and director of
  the short film _Desperate LA_ , and Rich's book _Black Venus Fly Trap_ was
  published in 2021 by _Deluge Books_. "
