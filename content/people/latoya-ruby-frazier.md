short_bio: "**LaToya Ruby Frazier** was born in 1982 in Braddock, Pennsylvania.
  Her practice spans a range of media including photography, video, performance,
  installation art and books, and centers on the nexus of social justice,
  cultural change, and commentary on the American experience. Frazier uses
  collaborative storytelling with the people who appear in her artwork to
  address topics of industrialism, rust belt revitalization, environmental
  justice, access to healthcare, access to clean water, workers’ rights, human
  rights, family, and communal history. This builds on her commitment to the
  legacy of 1930s social documentary work and 1960s and ’70s conceptual
  photography that address urgent social and political issues of everyday life.
  Frazier’s work has been featured in solo exhibitions worldwide."
