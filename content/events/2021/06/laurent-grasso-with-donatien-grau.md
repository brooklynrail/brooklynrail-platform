For the last four years, artist Laurent Grasso has been engaged in a conversation with *Brooklyn Rail* Editor-at-Large Donatien Grau for Grasso's installation and film project *Artificialis* at Musée d'Orsay—a film especially created for this institution, in conjunction with the exhibition *The Origins of the World, The Invention of Nature in the 19th century*. Grasso and Grau discuss their collaboration on this project as well as broader issues present in Grasso's work—the relation between history and futurism, the status of knowledge and images, the transformations of the world in which we live.
