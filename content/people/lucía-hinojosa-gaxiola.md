short_bio: "**Lucía Hinojosa Gaxiola** (Mexico City, 1987) is an artist, writer
  and editor working with language in a variety of ways, fusing her poetic
  practice with sound, film, drawing and installation to explore the materiality
  and transmutation of language. Her work also explores the somatic and
  improvisatory aspects of performance as a collaborative practice. She is the
  author of the chapbook _O_ (EBL/Cielo Abierto) and _The Telaraña Circuit_
  (Tender Buttons). Since 2013 she co-edits _diSONARE,_ an experimental
  editorial platform from Mexico City. "
