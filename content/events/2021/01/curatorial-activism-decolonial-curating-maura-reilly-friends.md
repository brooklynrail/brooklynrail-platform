    event_bio: "One of Australia’s most significant artists, Richard Bell works
      across painting, installation, performance and video work to explore the
      complex artistic and political problems of Western, colonial, and
      Indigenous art production. He grew out of a generation of Aboriginal
      activists and has remained committed to the politics of Aboriginal
      emancipation and self-determination. In 2003 he was the recipient of the
      Telstra National Aboriginal Art Award. Bell is represented in most major
      Australian National and State collections, and has exhibited in a number
      of solo exhibitions at important institutions in Australia and America. In
      2013 he was included in the National Gallery of Canada’s largest show of
      International Indigenous art, Sakàhan, and at the Fifth Moscow Biennale of
      Contemporary Art. In 2014, Bell’s solo exhibition Embassy opened at the
      Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts, Perth. In 2015, Bell presented a
      collaborative exhibition of new work with Emory Douglas at Milani Gallery,
      and exhibited his major work Embassy (2013-ongoing) as part of Performa
      15, New York City and the 16th Jakarta Biennale, curated by Charles Esche.
      Bell also premiered a body of new work as part of the Queensland Art
      Gallery/Gallery of Modern Art’s 8th Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary
      Art, Brisbane. In early 2016, BELL invites… an exhibition of Bell and work
      by friends and collaborators opened at the Stedelijk Museum SMBA,
      Amsterdam, and premiered a new sculptural commission as part of Sonsbeek
      2016 at the Dutch Art Institute in Arnhem, Netherlands. Bell presented
      Embassy as part of the 20th Biennale of Sydney, curated by Stephanie
      Rosenthal, at Cairns Indigenous Art Fair, the Institute of Modern Art,
      Brisbane, and most recently as part of the Jerusalem Show VIII. In 2017,
      Bell exhibited in The National: New Australian Art, a comprehensive survey
      of contemporary Australian art presented by the Museum of Contemporary
      Art, Art Gallery of New South Wales, and Carriageworks, Sydney. In 2018,
      he presented his solo exhibition Dredging up the Past at Gertrude
      Contemporary, Melbourne. In 2019, Bell took his Embassy project to the
      Venice Biennale as a collateral event and presented work at Padiglione
      d'Arte Contemporanea Milan. In 2021 Bell has a major solo exhibition at
      the MCA Sydney. In 2022 Bell will be presenting Embassy at the Tate
      Modern. He lives and works in Brisbane, Australia."

    event_bio: "Paul Chaat Smith (Comanche) joined the Smithsonian’s National Museum
      of the American Indian in 2001, where he now serves as Curator. His
      exhibitions include Americans, Stretching the Canvas, James Luna’s
      Emendatio, Fritz Scholder: Indian/Not Indian, and Brian Jungen: Strange
      Comfort. He’s the coauthor of Like a Hurricane: the Indian Movement from
      Alcatraz to Wounded Knee (The New Press, 1996), and Everything You Know
      about Indians Is Wrong (University of Minnesota Press, 2009). Although he
      spends most of his time crafting game-changing exhibitions and texts, he
      also enjoys reading obsessively about the early days of the Soviet space
      program, watching massive amounts of televised sports (pandemics
      permitting), and writing about himself in the third person."
