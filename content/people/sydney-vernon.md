short_bio: Artist **Sydney Vernon** superimposes personal family photographs and
  folklore with both real and imagined histories, quietly critiquing the global
  depiction of Black life and bodies. Combining elements of painting, drawing,
  and collage, Vernon’s multilayered works blend memory and history into new
  forms, at once imagining a poetic contextualization and a demand for
  recontextualization, coalescing symbols and ornaments with the spirit of her
  figures. Vernon earned her BFA at The Cooper Union, New York. Recent
  exhibitions include 125 Newbury, New York; Luce Gallery, Turin; Deli Gallery,
  New York, and Sargent’s Daughter’s, Los Angeles. She lives and works in
  Baltimore, MD.
