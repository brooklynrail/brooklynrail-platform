      Raphael Koenig is a Research Associate at the Comparative Literature
      Department at Harvard University, and recently completed a postdoctoral
      Fellowship at the Leonard A. Lauder Research Center for Modern Art of the
      Metropolitan Museum of Art. He is also a graduate of the Ecole Normale
      Supérieure and the Sorbonne in Paris. 


      Raphael’s research focuses on French, German, and Yiddish avant-garde literature and visual culture, more specifically on the interplay between mental health and artistic creation, from the historical avant-gardes’ reception of the “art of the insane” and “art brut” to contemporary art therapy workshops. 


      With Benny Shaffer, he co-curated Eye Eye Nose Mouth, an exhibition on art therapy workshops in China and Japan (Harvard University Asia Center, 2019). His collaboration with Arthur Fournier was featured at the 33rd Ljubljana Biennial of Graphic Arts (Crack up – Crack down, 2019, reviewed for the Brooklyn Rail by Osman Can Yerebekan).

The Prinzhorn collection, housed at the Heidelbeg University Hospital, was created in the 1920s with works made by mental health patients whose production had a long lasting impression on Jean Dubuffet. Founded in 1986, Yamanami Workshop (Shiga Prefecture) constitutes an attempt to improve the living conditions and promote broader acceptance of people with mental disabilities, by providing a supportive environment for participants to develop their artistic practices.
