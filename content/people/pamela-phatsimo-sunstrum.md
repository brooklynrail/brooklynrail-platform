short_bio: Born in Mochudi, Botswana in 1980, **Pamela Phatsimo Sunstrum’s**
  multidisciplinary practice encompasses drawing, painting, installation and
  animation. Her work alludes to mythology, geology and theories on the nature
  of the universe. Sunstrum’s drawings take the form of narrative landscapes
  that appear simultaneously futuristic and ancient, shifting between
  representational and fantastical depictions of volcanic, subterranean,
  cosmological and precipitous landscapes. One of Sunstrum’s most notable
  projects in London came in the form of a 2018 mural which wrapped around the
  exterior of The Showroom. The work was dedicated to South African Novelist
  Bessie Head and formed part of the exhibition titled Women on Aeroplanes,
  curated by The Otolith Group, Emily Pethick, and Elvira Dyangani Ose.
