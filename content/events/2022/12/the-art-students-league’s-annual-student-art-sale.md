About The Art Students League of New York:
The League was founded in 1875 by students breaking away from the National Academy of Design. That independent spirit remains at the League today, where students pursue their work unconstrained by dogma, politics or burdensome tuition. We educate students in the language and process of making art in an environment where anyone who wishes to pursue arts education can realize his or her full potential. The League fulfills this mission by offering affordable, high-quality education and instruction in painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture and assemblage. Artists who have studied at the League include Georgia O'Keeffe, Norman Rockwell, Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, Louise Bourgeois, Alexander Calder, James Rosenquist and Ai-Weiwei, among others. Today, more than 2,500 students of all ages, backgrounds and skill levels, study with the League each month in our landmark building and online.
