short_bio: "Born and raised in Portland, Oregon, **Jessi Reaves**holds a BFA
  from Rhode Island School of Design. Reaves combines iconic modernist design
  with an irreverent aesthetic in sculpture that toys with functionality. Often
  beginning with found furniture, which she dismantles, converts, remakes,
  enhances, pads, and embellishes in ways that still allow the suggestion of
  physical contact or use, she proposes that objects be examined visually and in
  terms of their purpose in life. She has been a part of many solo and
  two-person exhibitions, including  _Going Out in Style_, Herald St, London
  (2019), among others. She was awarded the Fall 2020 Teiger Mentor in the Arts
  from Cornell University.  "
