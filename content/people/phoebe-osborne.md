short_bio: Based in Brooklyn, NY, **Phoebe Osborne**’s works have been presented
  within the US and Europe, including commissions at Transmediale Berlin, La
  Caldera Barcelona, SFMoMA, Oakland Museum of California, and Lenfest Center
  for the Arts. They have shown work at E-flux Bar Laika, Southern Exposure, The
  Boiler Pierogi Gallery, and HetHEM in the Netherlands. Osborne was a 2017
  Impulstanz DanceWEB recipient, a 2018-2021 Hercules Art Studio

  identity, nation, and culture that divide and render intimacy insentient by
  reorienting towards a praxis of translation, relation, and care.
