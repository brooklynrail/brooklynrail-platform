short_bio: "Born in Lahore, Pakistan, Shahzia Sikander underwent rigorous
  training under master miniaturist Bashir Ahmed. She subsequently became the
  first artist from the Miniature Painting Department at the NCA to challenge
  the medium’s technical and aesthetic framework. Shahzia Sikander’s practice
  takes classical Indo-Persian miniature painting as its point of departure and
  challenges the strict formal tropes of the genre by experimenting with scale
  and various forms of new media. Informed by South Asian, American, Feminist
  and Muslim perspectives, Sikander has developed a unique, critically charged
  approach to this time-honored medium – employing its continuous capacity for
  reinvention to interrogate ideas of language, trade and empire, and migration.
