short_bio: "Widely considered to be one of the most influential and
  groundbreaking contemporary American artists. Born in 1945, and raised in Salt
  Lake City, he first established a multi-faceted artistic practice which sought
  to break the limitations of painting by using unorthodox materials such as
  bodily fluids and food. He has since become known for visceral, often
  hauntingly humorous work through performance, photography, film and video,
  sculpture, drawing and painting. For 18 years, McCarthy taught performance,
  video, installation, and art history in the New Genres Department at UCLA,
  where he influenced future generations of west coast artists and he has
  exhibited extensively worldwide. "
