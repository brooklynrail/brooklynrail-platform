name: Feminists for Jina
first_name: Feminists for Jina
short_bio: "**Feminists for Jina** is a network of feminist collectives and
  activists from different cities around the world, with diverse lived and
  learned experiences and viewpoints, united to echo and reinforce the voice of
  the ongoing “Jin, Jiyan, Azadî” Revolution of Iran and to strengthen its
  transnational elements. Since the beginning of the revolution in Iran, the
  slogan, “Jin, Jiyan, Azadî” has brought those of us in the diaspora together
  and Jina has become the symbol of our fight. The revolution has strengthened
  our determination to unite in order to achieve our goal of equality and
  freedom, and to fight alongside the people inside Iran and other feminist
  liberation movements for making a better world."
