A time to read up on abolitionist futures while crafting together, followed by time for conversation. It is crucial that we focus our energy right now on the Black Lives Matter movement, on educating ourselves, on holding each other accountable, and building solidarity. For this reason, we’ve decided to spend time together each Friday devoted to reading and crafting. This week, we’ll be reading "Abolition and Reparations: Histories of Resistance, Transformative Justice, and Accountability" by Patrisse Cullors.
