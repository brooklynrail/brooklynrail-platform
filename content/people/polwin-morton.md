short_bio: "**Pol Morton** is a chronically ill non-binary artist with an
  unreliable body making assemblage paintings about queerness, transness, and
  disability. Mortonâ€™s diaristic paintings attempt to locate the self when it is
  trapped, whether in a bed, in the home, or even within the body itself. Born
  in Palo Alto, California, they received their BFA from the Maryland Institute
  College of Art in Baltimore (2009) and their MFA at Hunter College in New York
  City (2022). Their work has been exhibited in at White Columns, New York; Bass
  and Reiner, San Francisco; and The Beijing American Center, among others."
