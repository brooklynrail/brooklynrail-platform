Over the past 21 years the _[Brooklyn Rail](https://brooklynrail.org/)_ has undertaken a miraculous journey, bringing together in a single monthly publication art, music, dance, film, theater, and literature, along with thoughtful social and political meditations. Inspired by the dedication of our artist friends and colleagues, and by their ability to live and work with uncertainties and doubts, we too are committed to the practice of the impractical by keeping the _Rail_ free, and also without a mission statement or a desire to exploit any specific demographic of readership. As it has been for the past 21 years, _The Brooklyn Rail_ is quite literally for everyone.



In recent years the _Brooklyn Rail_ has expanded its outreach. It has a robust online presence, and now reaches almost three million readers each month. And in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we launched our daily _[New Social Environment](https://brooklynrail.org/events)_ lunchtime conversations, which began on March 17, 2020, and takes place live on Zoom, weekdays at 1pm. This platform brings together our friends and colleagues from all the disciplines in the arts, the humanities, and science in an eminently democratic gathering of people from all over the world. These programs are recorded and are permanently available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg5494A8baDwbIhYazEAgIw). They are an embodiment of the great warmth and social intimacy that guides all the _Brooklyn Rail_’s endeavors. In response to the ongoing political and social crises of the past few years, we have used our expanded outreach to elevate the voices of people who have something to say that is worthwhile and significant.

We are also proud to have launched several ongoing new projects that further bring together our colleagues in the arts, humanities, and sciences. These include _[WE THE IMMIGRANTS](https://brooklynrail.org/projects/we-the-immigrants/)_, [Weekend Journal](https://www.instagram.com/brooklynrail/channel/), [Art-in-Transit](https://www.instagram.com/brooklynrail/channel/), [Poetry-in-Transit](https://www.instagram.com/brooklynrail/channel/), and [Music-in-Transit](https://www.instagram.com/brooklynrail/channel/). We have discovered with profound joy how these projects have a synergetic effect, opening dialogues between various fields and disciplines, and bringing together the older and younger generations, who have largely been kept separate for far too long. We’re also poised to mobilize the intelligence and wisdom of our mentors and friends in the academy with the wisdom of people in the outside world, since the privilege of passing on the baton of culture is the key to all our futures.

As many of you know, for the past 21 years. _The Brooklyn Rail_ has led a kind of hand-to-mouth existence, constantly in need of funds to pay its staff, contributors, and production people. So, with the blessing of our board of directors we have decided to establish a first-ever endowment for the _Rail_, as a way of celebrating our 21st anniversary and the ongoing vitality of our programs. 


This is one of the goals of the _Brooklyn Rail_. Please add your voice to the symphony.

In solidarity, deep appreciation, with love and courage as ever,

— Phong H. Bui

Founded in October 2000, the [Brooklyn Rail](https://brooklynrail.org/) provides an independent forum for arts, culture, and politics throughout New York City and far beyond.

Our journal features criticism of visual art, music, dance, film, theater and literature, alongside thoughtful political commentary and original fiction and poetry.

The Rail is distributed free of charge both in print and online, and further fulfills its mission by curating art exhibitions, panel discussions, reading series and film screenings that reflect the complexity and inventiveness of the city’s
artistic and cultural landscape. [Learn more »](https://brooklynrail.org/about)
