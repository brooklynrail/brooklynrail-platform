short_bio: "**Camille Hoffmanâ€™s** practice is a ceremony of reconfiguration and
  critical reflection on the romantic American landscape. Considering the
  embedded and latent meanings around light, nature, the frontier, borders,
  race, gender and power in influential American landscape paintings, she uses
  materials collected from childhood and her everyday life to craft imaginary
  landscapes that are grounded in accumulation, personal narrative, and
  historical critique. Taking inspiration from the Philippine weaving and
  storytelling traditions of her ancestors, along with traditional landscape
  painting techniques from her academic training, she interweaves image with
  refuse to reveal seamless yet textured transcultural contradictions. She lives
  and works in New York City and teaches at The Cooper Union."
