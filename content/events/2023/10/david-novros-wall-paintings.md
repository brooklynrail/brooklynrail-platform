An exhibition of new paintings by David Novros will open at Paula Cooper Gallery on Saturday October 28, 2023. Monumentally scaled to the galleryâ€™s main location at 534 West 21st Street, the works each measure between thirteen and fifteen feet wide and are comprised of modular painted panels and large open areas of wall. Novros is known for his meticulous attention to the materiality of color, and his newest paintings radiate with exceedingly vibrant and deep complementary hues. The exhibition will be accompanied by an illustrated catalogue with an essay by Ann Lauterbach.
