short_bio: "**Bing Lee** is an artist and founding member of Godzilla Asian
  American Arts Network, Epoxy Art Group and Tomato Grey. He initiated the
  ongoing project _Pictodiary_ in 1983, and has committed to making iconographic
  journals daily as his significant portrayal of work. The artist’s
  comprehensive visual vocabulary developed in the _Pictodiary_ appears in large
  scale murals and in works on paper. Lee’s work has also been the subject of
  site-specific public art projects, including the Canal Street Subway Station
  in New York City and Kowloon Tong Station in Hong Kong, among others."
