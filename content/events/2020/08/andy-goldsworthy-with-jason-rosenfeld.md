      In a diverse career spanning four decades, Andy Goldsworthy has become one
      of the most prominent and iconic contemporary sculptors. In photographs,
      sculptures, installations, and films, Goldsworthy documents his
      explorations of the effects of time, the relationship between humans and
      their natural surroundings, and the beauty in loss and regeneration.
      Goldsworthy’s permanent projects and ephemeral works contrast in their
      scale, tension, and lifetime, but are unified through their responses to
      the environment and his constant investigation into understanding the
      landscape he is in. 


      Recent permanent site-specific installations by Goldsworthy include Stone Sea, Saint Louis Art Museum, Missouri; Chaumont Cairn, Domaine de Chaumont-sur-Loire, France; Path and Rising Stone, Albright Knox Art Gallery, New York; and Wood Line, Presidio of San Francisco, California.  


      Other permanent works can be seen at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; de Young Museum, California; Museum of Jewish Heritage, New York; Storm King Art Center, New York; Stanford University, California; and Haute Provence Geological Reserve in Digne-les-Bains, France, among numerous other sites. Major solo exhibitions of Goldsworthy's work have been presented by the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, England; Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Spain; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Neuberger Museum of Art, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, California; and Des Moines Art Center, Illinois.


      The artist was born in Cheshire, England, in 1956, and is now based in Scotland.
