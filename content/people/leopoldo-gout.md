short_bio: "**Leopoldo Goût** is an artist, writer, and filmmaker who works
  across mediums to capture the ephemeral: an abstract and figurative clash with
  memory and humanity, with chaos. Born in Mexico City, he embarked on numerous
  artistic pursuits: painting, drawing, sculpture, filmmaking, digital art,
  soundscapes, performance, and more. His work has appeared in galleries and
  museums throughout the world, including The West Collection of Pennsylvania,
  The Museo de Arte Contemporáneo in Mexico City, Galeria Museo of Bogota,
  Colombia, The Dikeou Collection, The Pritzker Collection, Tricia Collins
  Contemporary Art, Sandra Gering, Jack Tilton, and PS1."
