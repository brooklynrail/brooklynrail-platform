short_bio: Nationally-acclaimed American poet and author Ramya Ramana made her
  debut in 2014 at the inauguration of Mayor Bill De Blasio, where she was asked
  to perform an original piece. She then went on to perform at over 200 venues
  in a year as the Youth Poet Laureate of NYC, making mentions in the New York
  Times, Wall Street Journal, Brown Girl Magazine, and many more. Ramana's first
  manuscript, "Don't Drown Her in the Baptism", explores femininity, faith, and
  race. As a first-generation Indian-American, Ramana's work illustrates
  immigrant experience and explores existentialism. Her upcoming projects
  include a spoken word album, and songwriting. She is currently receiving her
  MFA in poetry at The New School.
