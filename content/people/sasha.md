short_bio: Sasha lives in NY and calls her dog, ‘brother.’ Lately, she is
  writing with a diffusion of subjectivities through structures, and enjoying
  things that shift. "Here I Felt Grounded and Saw The World" is her first book
  of poetry. She received her MFA from Bard College and her writing appears in
  Waxing and Waning, Vol No. 2, and as press releases for musicians.
