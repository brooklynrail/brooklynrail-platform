    event_bio: David Opdyke is an artist known for his trenchant political send-ups
      of American culture. Opdyke’s political awakening in the early 2000s led
      to a body of work that confronts the horrors of contemporary America. His
      hyperreal topographical models of suburbs comment on mall culture and
      suburban sprawl, while his sculptures of ruined monuments mock
      imperialistic hubris. His work is held in the collections of the Brooklyn
      Museum, MoMA, and the Washington Convention Center.

David Opdyke’s *[This Land](https://www.manacontemporary.com/exhibition/david-opdyke-this-land/)* is an epic mural fashioned out of vintage American postcards, which the artist then treated with disconcerting painted interventions—highlighting the climate crisis. A book by the same name affords readers a closer viewing of Opdyke’s devastatingly sardonic take on our impending ecological future. Interspersed among the detailed visual sections of the book are insightful thematic essays by Lawrence Weschler and an afterword that serves as a stirring call to action, by civil rights attorney and current New York City mayoral candidate Maya Wiley.

Join David Opdyke, Lawrence Weschler, and Maya Wiley for a conversation on *This Land*’s mural vignettes, the corrupted system that got us here, and what it will take to make a new future.
