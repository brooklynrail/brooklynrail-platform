short_bio: "**Steve Locke** (b.1963) was born in Cleveland, OH and lives and
  works in the Hudson Valley, NY. Spanning painting, drawing, sculpture, and
  installation, Locke’s practice critically engages with the Western canon to
  interrogate the connections between desire, identity, and violence. Extending
  his commitment to a painting practice, he began to seek alternative ways to
  amplify public engagement around his art, partnering with institutions,
  municipalities, and even the US Postal Service to reach new audiences.
  Throughout his artistic career, Locke’s practice has questioned how we ascribe
  meaning to portraiture and pushes viewers to confront and critically engage
  with a complicated present and painful past."
