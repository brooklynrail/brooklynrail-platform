short_bio: "Jazz pianist, composer, and performance artist Jason Moran is the
  Artistic Director for Jazz at The Kennedy Center. He currently teaches at the
  New England Conservatory. Moran is deeply invested in reassessing and
  complicating the relationship between music and language, and his extensive
  efforts in composition, improvisation, and performance are all geared towards
  challenging the status quo while respecting the accomplishments of his
  predecessors. His activity stretches beyond the many recordings and
  performances with masters of the form including Charles Lloyd, Bill Frisell,
  and the late Sam Rivers, and his work with his trio The Bandwagon has resulted
  in a profound discography for Blue Note Records. "
