The *Brooklyn Rail*’s Film section believes big questions are essential to envisioning engaged and responsible cinema. From the environmental crisis to spirituality, the films we cover embrace fraught scenarios, complex ideas, and innovative practices of storytelling. From July 24-28, enjoy five films selected by our Film Editors Laura Jane Valenza and Edward Charles Mendez. Together, these stunning films celebrate and amplify unique approaches.

*North by Current* is a visual rumination on the understated relationships between mothers and children, truths and myths, losses and gains. After the inconclusive death of his young niece, filmmaker Angelo Madsen Minax returns to his rural Michigan hometown, preparing to make a film about a broken criminal justice system. Instead, he pivots to excavate the depths of generational addiction, Christian fervor, and trans embodiment. Lyrically assembled images, decades of home movies, and ethereal narration form an idiosyncratic and poetic undertow that guide a viewer through lifetimes and relationships. Like the relentless Michigan seasons, the meaning of family shifts, as Madsen, his sister, and his parents strive tirelessly to accept each other. Poised to incite more internal searching than provide clear statements or easy answers, *North by Current* dives head first into the challenges of creating identity, the agony of growing up, and the ever-fickle nuances of family.
