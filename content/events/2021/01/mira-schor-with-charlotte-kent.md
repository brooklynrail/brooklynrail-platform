    event_bio: "Mira Schor is a New York based painter and writer. Her work has
      always been steeped in the political, the historical, the personal, and
      the material, including major periods in which gendered narrative and
      representation of the body have been featured; in other periods the focus
      of her work has been representation of language in drawing and painting.
      Schor’s recent work has focused on the experience of living in a moment of
      radical inequality, climate and political catastrophe, and accelerated
      time, set against the powerful pull of older notions of time, craft, and
      visual pleasure. She is the author of A Decade of Negative Thinking:
      Essays on Art, Politics, and Daily Life (2009), Wet: On Painting,
      Feminism, and Art Culture (1997) and of the blog A Year of Positive
      Thinking. She was the co-founder and co-editor with fellow painter Susan
      Bee of the journal and thirty-year editorial project M/E/A/N/I/N/G. Schor
      is the recipient of many prestigious awards including a Guggenheim
      Fellowship in Painting, a Pollock Krasner Grant, the College Art
      Association’s Frank Jewett Mather Award in Art Criticism, and the Creative
      Capital / Warhol Foundation Arts Writers Grant. In 2017 she was elected to
      the National Academy. Schor is the recipient of the 2019 Women’s Caucus
      for Art Lifetime Achievement Award for her work as a feminist painter, art
      historian, and critic and is the recipient of  a 2019-2020 Sharpe Walentas
      Studio Program Residency. She is represented by Lyles & King Gallery in
      New York City."
