short_bio: "While studying at San Francisco State University, Sally Saul became
  acquainted with the Bay Area visual arts movement, characterized by a penchant
  for bright colors and an interest in drawing subject matter from day-to- day
  life.  In the early 1980s Saul relocated to Austin where she enrolled in
  ceramics courses at the University of Texas, and began to formalize her
  process. Informed by memory, her sculptures explore complexities of the human
  condition. In recent years Saul has achieved significant milestones in her
  career. Her first survey exhibition Blue Hills, Yellow Tree, opened in 2019 at
  Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, NY. She has also participated in exhibitions at
  venues including Jeffrey Deitch, the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, White
  Columns, and many others. "
