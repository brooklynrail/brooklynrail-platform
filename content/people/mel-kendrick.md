short_bio: "A preeminent American sculptor, **Mel Kendrick**â€™s thoroughgoing
  practice has involved the use of cast bronze, concrete, a variety of woods,
  rubber, resin, as well as investigations with cast paper. Kendrick addresses
  philosophical, conceptual, and fundamental questions around sculpture: namely,
  the relationship between the object as we experience it and the clearly
  evident means by which it was created. Currently Kendrick is the subject of a
  traveling retrospective, now on view at the Addison Gallery of American Art in
  Andover, MA (traveling to the Parrish Art Museum, Water Mill, NY)."
