      Alanah Odoms is a civil rights leader, mother, and a professional and
      spiritual support to countless activists across Louisiana and beyond. As
      the first Black woman to lead the ACLU of Louisiana in its 65 year
      history, she has answered the call to defend the Constitution and the Bill
      of Rights by challenging systemic racial and gender injustice – vestiges
      of slavery displayed most prominently in Louisiana’s epidemic of mass
      incarceration, immigrant detention and deportation, and racist policing
      across the state. 


      In the midst of a global pandemic that impacts Black people at disproportionate rates, and civil unrest against police brutality and systemic racism, ACLU of Louisiana aims to dismantle white supremacy in our laws and in the legal system-  and move our state toward solidarity and collective liberation.
