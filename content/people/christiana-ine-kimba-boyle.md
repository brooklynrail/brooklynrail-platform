short_bio: "Curator and art dealer based in New York City, **Christiana
  Ine-Kimba Boyle** was recently appointed the title of Director of Online Sales
  at Pace Galleryâ€”managing the gallery's digital helm and recent foray into the
  NFT market. Christiana made her curatorial debut in April with the group
  exhibition _Black Femme: Sovereign of WAP and the Virtual Realm_, which
  featured work by six black female-identifying artists: Caitlin Cherry,
  Delphine Desane, Emily Manwaring, Kenya (Robinson), Sydney Vernon, and
  Qualeasha Wood. The exhibition supported a deconstructive discourse around
  femininity, sexuality, and gender politics through a post-internet lens."
