  multifaceted creative working in visual art, filmmaking, and writing. She
  holds a PhD in Creative Writing from the University of Manchester. Her
  project, _Hum, and After the Cut,_ consisted of a film script and a
  dissertation that intertwined personal narrative, history, and close looking
  into Islamic miniature paintings to consider the practice of female genital
  cutting and its representation reparatively. _Unmarked Pleasures,_ an essay
  based on this work, comes out in the edited anthology, _Gestures: A Body of
  Work_ (Manchester University Press, forthcoming). Her artwork and films have
  been shown at Montreal Museum of Fine Arts; CPH:DOX; Locarno; and Sundance.
  She's scheduled to premiere her fiction film, _Sweet Lime,_ in 2023."
