Thirty years after the tragic and courageous struggle that led the Lithuanian people to regain their independence, two international online panel discussions will be dedicated to Jonas Mekas and his last book, which retraces those events from a personal perspective. Titled *Transcript 04 44’ 14” Lithuania and the Collapse of the USSR* (Humboldt Books, 2020), the book originates from a movie by Mekas which is at the same time a precious historical document and an important piece of avant-garde cinema.

The curators of the publication, Francesco Urbano Ragazzi, will dialogue with other thinkers, artists, and historians in a virtual roundtable involving Italy, France, Israel, Lithuania, and the U.S.

Organized by the Lithuanian Culture Institute in these different countries in collaboration with Humboldt Books and the Anthology Film Archives, the 2-day event will be hosted by Scandinavia House and the *Brooklyn Rail*.

The first event in this series will be [on January 13 at Scandinavia House](http://www.scandinaviahouse.org/events/virtual-panel-jonas-mekas-filming-independence/). The special guest of the gathering will be the first Head of State of the Republic of Lithuania, Vytautas Landsbergis, who described Jonas Mekas’ book with the following words: “Lithuania became part of the American life for some months, for one year, for two years and Jonas took it into his evidence, into his camera. Jonas comes as a reminder and does present Lithuania as a reminder. Lithuania is a little reminder of very great things.” [Learn more about this event on scandinaviahouse.org »](http://www.scandinaviahouse.org/events/virtual-panel-jonas-mekas-filming-independence/).
