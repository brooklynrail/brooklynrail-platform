    event_bio: "Kent Monkman is an interdisciplinary Cree visual artist. A member of
      Fisher River Cree Nation in Treaty 5 Territory (Manitoba), he lives and
      works in Dish With One Spoon Territory (Toronto, Canada). Known for his
      provocative interventions into Western European and American art history,
      Monkman explores themes of colonization, sexuality, loss, and
      resilience—the complexities of historic and contemporary Indigenous
      experiences—across painting, film/video, performance, and installation.
      Monkman’s gender-fluid alter ego Miss Chief Eagle Testickle often appears
      in his work as a time-traveling, shape-shifting, supernatural being who
      reverses the colonial gaze to challenge received notions of history and
      Indigenous peoples. "
