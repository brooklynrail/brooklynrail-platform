short_bio: Yun-Fei Ji (b. 1963, Beijing, China) earned his BFA from Central
  Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing and his MFA from University of Arkansas at
  Fayetteville. Ji received the 2006 American Academy Prix de Rome Fellowship
  and Residency, and was the 2007 Artist-in-residence at the Parasol Unit
  Foundation for Contemporary Art in London. In his practice, Ji utilizes the
  symbols of folkloric tradition to speak truth to power. Full of phantoms,
  demons, and other spectral characters, Ji’s paintings have frequently
  functioned as metaphorical critiques of oppressive power structures—and
  strategies of defiance. In his ink and watercolor compositions, these ghostly
  figures are stand-ins for the complex political undercurrents and cultural
  tug-of-war shaping rural communities in a rapidly developing world.
