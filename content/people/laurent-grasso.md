short_bio: Born in 1972, French conceptual artist **Laurent Grasso** creates
  mysterious atmospheres through immersive and labyrinthine installations that
  challenge the boundaries of our perceptions and knowledge. Like a film
  director, he arranges and stages diverse realities in order to create hypnotic
  systems. Often conceived as quasi-autonomous vision machines, Grassoâ€™s
  projects attempt to capture and restore phenomena invisible to the human eye
  and mind. Their scopic dimension questions the will to control, whether it is
  a question of surveillance, political power, military strategy, or astronomy.
  Combining the most prospective theories and scientific tools with the oldest
  beliefs, his works invite us to travel through time and into an interfolding
  of worlds.
