short_bio: "Born in Philadelphia in 1943, **Howardena Pindell** studied painting
  at Boston University and Yale University. In 1979, she began teaching at the
  State University of New York, Stony Brook where she is now a full professor.
  Throughout her career, Pindell has exhibited extensively. Notable
  solo-exhibitions include: Just Above Midtown (1977, NY), The Studio Museum in
  Harlem (1986, NY), Garth Greenan Gallery, New York (2014), and Spelman College
  Museum of Fine Art, Atlanta (2015). Pindell often employs lengthy,
  metaphorical processes of destruction/reconstruction. In her later, more
  politically charged work. Pindell reverts to thematic focuses in order to
  address social issues of homelessness, AIDs, war, genocide, sexism,
  xenophobia, and apartheid."
