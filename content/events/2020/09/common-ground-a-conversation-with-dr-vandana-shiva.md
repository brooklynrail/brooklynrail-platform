    event_bio: Dr. Vandana Shiva is a world-renowned scholar and tireless crusader
      for economic, food, and gender justice. Dr. Shiva was trained as a
      physicist, and later shifted her focus to interdisciplinary research in
      science, technology and environmental policy. In 1982, she founded an
      independent institute, the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and
      Ecology which was dedicated to high quality and independent research to
      address the most significant ecological and social issues of our times in
      close partnership with local communities and social movements. In 1991,
      she founded Navdanya, a national movement to protect the diversity and
      integrity of living resources, especially native seed, and to promote
      organic farming and fair trade. In 2004, in collaboration with Schumacher
      College, U.K., she started Bija Vidyapeeth (Earth University), an
      international college for sustainable living in the Doon Valley in
      Northern India. Time Magazine identified Dr. Shiva as an environmental
      “hero” in 2003 and Asia Week has called her one of the five most powerful
      communicators of Asia. Forbes magazine in November 2010 identified Dr.
      Vandana Shiva as one of the top Seven most Powerful Women on the Globe.
      Among her many awards are the Alternative Nobel Prize (Right Livelihood
      Award, 1993), Order of the Golden Ark, the UN’s Global 500 Roll of Honour,
      and The MIDORI Prize for Biodiversity in 2016.
  - person: lauren-bon
    event_bio: "Lauren Bon is an environmental artist from Los Angeles, CA. Her
      practice, Metabolic Studio, explores self-sustaining and self-diversifying
      systems of exchange that feed emergent properties that regenerate the life
      web. Some of her works include: Not A Cornfield, which transformed and
      revived an industrial brownfield in downtown Los Angeles into a
      thirty-two-acre cornfield for one agricultural cycle; 100 Mules Walking
      the Los Angeles Aqueduct, a 240-mile performative action that aimed to
      reconnect the city of Los Angeles with the source of its water for the
      centenary of the opening of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. Her studio’s current
      work, Bending the River Back into the City, aims to utilize Los Angeles’
      first private water right to deliver 106-acre feet of water annually from
      the LA River to over 50 acres of land in the historic core of downtown LA.
      This model can be replicated to regenerate the 52-mile LA River, reconnect
      it to its floodplain and form a citizens’ utility."
  - person: nance-klehm
    event_bio: "Nance Klehm’s work and being lies at the complex intersections of
      the theory and practice of land politics and soil health. Her work as a
      communicator, translator, curator, provocateur, and medium is
      internationally recognized in communities of practice ranging from
      publishing to fine art, environmental justice activism to philosophy,
      growing to podcasting. She lives her work—she writes, facilitates,
      lectures, teaches, consults, makes, and does. She marries these two sets
      of practice under two organizing structures: Spontaneous Vegetation and
      Social Ecologies."
  - person: milli-macen-moore
    event_bio: Milli Macen-Moore is a regenerative urban grower and a steward of the
      environment. She directs Metabolic Studio’s Farmlab, under the mission to
      combat climate change and mass extinction through the study and applied
      science of living systems. Milli’s work at the Metabolic Studio explores
      the many roles that vegetation plays in remediation, food systems, soil
      building, restoration, and community science.

Please join us for our fifth installment of *Common Ground* as we partner with our friends at [Metabolic Studio](https://www.metabolicstudio.org/about) for a conversation on ecological resilience, food sovereignty, environmental stewardship, and soil-building and seed-saving as crucial acts of resistance. We will be joined by environmental activist and physicist **Dr. Vandana Shiva** in conversation with **Lauren Bon**, Los Angeles-based environmental artist of the Metabolic Studio, **Nance Klehm**, Chicago-based ecological systems designer and permaculture grower, and **Milli Macen-Moore**, regenerative urban grower and director of Metabolic's [*Farmlab* program](https://www.metabolicstudio.org/tags/farmlab) which works to combat climate change and mass extinction through the study of living systems. 

This conversation marks six months since we first heard from Dr. Shiva, tuning in from her mother's home in Dehradun, India, as part of Metabolic Studio's *[Interdependence Salon #3](https://brooklynrail.org/events/2020/05/07/dr-vandana-shiva-with-lauren-bon/)*. Back in May, Dr. Shiva encouraged us all to ***get planting* *as an act of resistance*.** This week's *Common Ground* will build upon this first conversation earlier in the year, and the deep history of collaboration and cross-pollination between Dr. Shiva and Lauren Bon, and will offer a space for us to reflect on our institutional memory and share all that has happened in the six month space between now and then. We hope to hear from Metabolic Studio on their network of Satyagraha gardens they have been cultivating across the country, from Nance Klehm on her recent projects with indigenous ecology, and from Dr. Shiva on the Commons of the Mind, and beyond. 

We will close with a reading by Afghan American poet **Zohra Saed**.

### About this series

At the start of quarantine, the *Brooklyn Rail* asked how might we stay connected to each other in a time of self-isolation? Now we ask: How can we stay involved and engaged in upholding our civic responsibility to one another across communities? How can we deploy this community built through the *New Social Environment*—through hundreds of conversations and meals shared over the past six months—to mobilize daily action for grassroots movements, social justice and equity projects, and for the political good of our most marginalized communities across the nation? Tune in Thursdays at 1pm for *Common Ground*, a new lunchtime series featuring weekly conversations with social justice practitioners, changemakers, and activists on how we can mobilize our daily actions to radically reimagine our democracy.

### More from Metabolic Studio

For the next twelve weeks, Metabolic Studio will be educating themselves and others about the “Fires of the West” with a specific focus on Native land management and sovereignty, the history of fire suppression, and how we can decolonize our understanding of fire moving forward to create a safer and more resilient West.

Join Metabolic for their first conversation on *The Fires of the West Learning and Native Plant Embroidery Circle* Friday, October 2 at 8:30pm EST / 5:30pm PST.
