name: Richard Tuttle
first_name: Richard
last_name: Tuttle
short_bio: One of the most representative American artists of the postwar
  period, occupying interstitial positions between several genres, including
  painting, sculpture, drawing, and poetry. He consistently opens new
  possibilities for a variety of mediums and materials, demonstrating how
  traditional categories of artmaking can function as starting points for
  unhindered, open investigations into the functioning of perception and
  language. His early encounters with artists and artworks associated with pop
  and minimalism laid the groundwork for a project precipitated on reinvention
  and change. Since the 1970s, Richard Tuttle (b. 1941, Rahway, New Jersey) has
  been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions at museums throughout the world.
  Tuttle lives and works in New York and Abiqui√∫, New Mexico.
