*How To Make A Revolution Without Giving Offense Or Arousing Resentment* is a new play from Kimberly Golding, Jordan Jones, and Sam Myers, proudly presented in collaboration with the Brooklyn Rail. *How To Make A Revolution* follows T (Tẹmídayọ Amay), a melancholy marketing associate at The Museum, a self-interested, albeit well-intentioned, highly bureaucratic institution. Following an Unnamed Tragedy that the marketing team must address, T stumbles upon a zine in their office printer which leads them to a group of revolutionary anti-Museum organizers who operate out of a mailroom closet, daring to imagine something different. “Lots of conversation about art-making inside art institutions” were a critical part of developing *How To Make A Revolution*, which seeks to address how we make our ideas physical and communicable, and how form, context, and process shape their ultimate impact. Featuring performances by Sarah Chalfie, Tony Jenkins, Arjun Biju, and Nile Assata Harrris, *How To Make A Revolution* will be presented three times across August 18 and 19, 2023 at the Brooklyn Rail’s popup gallery at 900 Third Avenue in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. 

Admission will be free and open to the public. Space is limited—RSVPs and early arrivals are encouraged.
