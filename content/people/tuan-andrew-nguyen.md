short_bio: "**Tuan Andrew Nguyen** (b. 1976, Saigon, Vietnam; he/him) is an
  artist whose work utilizes strategies of remembrance to highlight unofficial
  and suppressed histories. Interweaving the factual and the speculative and
  often employing mythologies of otherworldly realms, Nguyen’s films re-work
  dominant narratives into stories that propose creative forms of healing the
  intergenerational traumas of colonialism, war, and displacement. Through his
  interest in animism and material memory, the affective and historical charge
  embedded into objects, Nguyen’s installations and sculptural practice coincide
  with and expand on the themes explored in his films."
