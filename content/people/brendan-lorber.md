short_bio: "**Brendan Lorber** is the author of *If this is paradise why are we
  still driving?* and several chapbooks, including *Unfixed Elegy and Other
  Poems*. He’s had work in *The American Poetry Review, Fence, McSweeney’s, can
  we have our ball back* and elsewhere. Since 1995 he has edited *Lungfull!
  Magazine*, currently in hibernation, an annual anthology of contemporary
  literature that prints the rough draft of contributors’ work in addition to
  the final version in order to reveal the creative process. He’s also edited
  *The Poetry Project Newsletter* and ran the Zinc Bar Reading Series for so
  long. He lives atop the tallest hill in Brooklyn, in a little castle across
  the street from a five-hundred-acre necropolis where he’s working on a ghost
  story."
