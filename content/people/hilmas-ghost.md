short_bio: "**Hilmaâ€™s Ghost** is a feminist artist collective founded by
  Brooklyn-based artists **Sharmistha Ray** and **Dannielle Tegeder.** The
  collective makes work collaboratively, conducts experimental pedagogy, and
  engages in transcultural research and dialogue through the lens of feminism
  and spirituality to build community and reckon with patriarchal art histories
  that have excluded women, trans, and nonbinary practitioners. Solo and group
  exhibitions include _Schema: World as Diagram_, Marlborough Gallery, NY and
  _Radical Spirits,_ Hill-Stead Museum, CT (2022); among others. They have
  upcoming projects and exhibitions at The Aldrich Museum, CT; Carrie Secrist
  Gallery, Chicago; and Gallery RGR, Mexico City. "
