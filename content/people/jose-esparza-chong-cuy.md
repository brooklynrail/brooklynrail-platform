  Curator of Storefront for Art and Architecture. At Storefront, José introduced
  a new curatorial framework called Building Cycles, which presents a year-long

  places, and relationships with and within our surroundings. Before his role at
  Storefront, José served as the Pamela Alper Associate Curator at the Museum of
  Contemporary Art Chicago (MCA), which he joined in 2016. Prior to the MCA,
