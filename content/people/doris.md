short_bio: "**Doris Salcedo** describes her work as ‘a topology of mourning’; in
  each of her sculptures, installations and public projects Salcedo bears
  witness to life that has become the casualty of a political agenda. Living and
  working in Bogotá, Salcedo draws on her own experience of Colombia’s violent
  political history, as well as responding to wider global concerns. She focuses
  on those who have disappeared or are politically invisible. Reflecting on a
  contemporary human condition scarred by war, migration, economic challenges
  and personal loss, the artist’s practice is further informed by a deep
  engagement with philosophy, literature and poetry. Her solo exhibitions
  include Fondation Beyeler, Basel (2023) and Glenstone, Travilah, Maryland
  (2022), among many others."
