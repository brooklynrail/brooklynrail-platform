  Both graduated from Stroganoff Art Academy in 1967. In 1972, Komar and Melamid
  founded Sots Art - conceptual eclectic art based on cliches of the Soviet
  propaganda and the world's art history. In 1974 their works, made in
  collaboration, were destroyed by the Soviet authorities during the disbanded
  \"Bulldozer Exhibition\" - the unofficial artists' group show. In 1976 they
  works were smuggled out to New York and had a successful show at Ronald
  Feldman Gallery. Komar & Melamid have lived in New York since 1978 and
  participated in numerous international exhibitions, including Documenta,
  Kassel and Venice Biennale. In 2003, Komar and Melamid ended their
