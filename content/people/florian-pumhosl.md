short_bio: "**Florian Pumhösl** (b. 1971, Vienna) lives and works in Vienna and
  Munich.  Pumhösl’s works—reliefs, paintings, drawings, films and
  installations— are constituted by themes and references encoded within a
  visual language that appears formal. Through the selection, reduction,
  rearrangement, and reproduction of his motifs and source materials—procedures
  of transcription—the artist arrives at a vocabulary that is at once abstract
  and semiotically motivated. Recurrently interested in formal processes
  undergone in relation to terrain, Pumhösl’s latest work departs from a
  longstanding involvement with human land-shaping above ground to derive forms
  emergent in subterranean zones."
