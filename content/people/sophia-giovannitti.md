first_name: Sophia
last_name: Giovannitti
short_bio: "**Sophia Giovannitti** is a conceptual artist who studies the total
  commodification of the parts of ourselves we hold dear, positing, from a
  materialist perspective, that there is no way out but through. She is
  interested in: choreographic failure; money; the ongoing distortion of reality
  through images and language; autonomy; revenge; the disappointments and
  casualties of modern feminism; narcissism. She attempts to exploit,
  transgress, and re-choreograph traditional modes of value extraction from
  artists. Her work has been shown at Recess, the Athens Biennale, Duplex, PPOW,
  and the ICA London, among others. She is the author of _Working Girl: On
  Selling Art and Selling Sex_ (Verso, 2023). Her work exists largely in the
  through-space of sale, scam, betrayal, and reflection."
