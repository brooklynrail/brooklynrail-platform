short_bio: David Nolan founded David Nolan Gallery in 1987, specializing in
  modern and contemporary works by an array of international artists working in
  a variety of media. The gallery’s original mission was to exhibit contemporary
  works on paper along with painting and sculptures by American and European
  artists, and to produce monographs together with tightly curated historical
  exhibitions. The first solo show at the gallery – an exhibition of early
  drawings by Sigmar Polke - was followed by presentations of now-canonical
  German artists, including Georg Baselitz, Martin Kippenberger, Dieter Roth,
  Gerhard Richter, Rosemarie Trockel and Albert Oehlen. In Spring 2020, the
  gallery announced its newest location on the Upper East Side inaugurated with
  an exhibition of works on paper by Jorinde Voigt.
