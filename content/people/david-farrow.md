short_bio: "**David Farrow** is an American sound artist, researcher, and
  ethnomusicologist based in New York City. Farrow's artistic work employs
  noise, synthesis, and field recordings to explore how sound and listening
  practices construct political space. They are completing their PhD in
  Ethnomusicology at Columbia University examining the limits of do-it-yourself
  music scenes' cultural and economic autonomy within capitalist urban
  development. Farrow's writing has appeared in _Current Musicology, Tiny Mix
  Tapes,_ and zines published by evil dentist. Farrow's audio/visual
  installation work has been exhibited at the University of London. They perform
  experimental electronic music as “certain lives” within New York’s
  experimental, rave, and independent music scenes."
