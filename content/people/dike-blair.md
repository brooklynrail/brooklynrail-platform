short_bio: "**Dike Blair** (b. 1952, New Castle, Pennsylvania) uses gouache,
  oil, his own photographs, and strategies appropriated from Postminimalist
  sculpture to create intimate tableaux that transform quotidian sights and
  materials into exercises in formalism. A writer and teacher as well as an
  artist, Blair came up in the downtown scene of 1970s New York among punk
  rockers and Postmodernists. In the early 1980s, against prevailing art world
  trends toward Neo-Expressionism, he began rendering scenes from his life in
  gouache on paper. These ongoing diaristic paintings are devoid of human
  figures but nonetheless evoke the specter of the artist whose daily life plays
  out at a remove across their finely-wrought surfaces. "
