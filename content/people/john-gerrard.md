short_bio: Breaching the divisions between portrait, landscape, and history
  painting, and now exploring an expanded arena of choreography and performance,
  the innovative form of **John Gerrard**’s work keeps pace with the subtle
  complexity of its subject-matter. Gerrard has developed a sophisticated method
  of trans-historical collage, overlaying terrain, figure, image, and gesture
  captured from real bodies and sites. The resulting works are sculptures that
  exist in virtual space, within environments that include complex algorithmic
  choreographies, multiple moving viewpoints, and realistic cycles of day and
  night that unfold in ‘real time’ over the course of an entire year. _(Bio text
