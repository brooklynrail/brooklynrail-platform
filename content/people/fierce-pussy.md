short_bio: "**fierce pussy** is a collective of queer women artists. Formed in
  New York City in 1991 through our immersion in AIDS activism during a decade
  of increasing political mobilization around gay rights, fierce pussy brought
  lesbian identity and visibility directly into the streets. Low-tech and low
  budget, the collective responded to the urgency of those years, using readily
  available resources: old typewriters, found photographs, our own baby
  pictures, and the printing supplies and equipment accessible in our day jobs.
  Four of the original core members—Nancy Brooks Brody, Joy Episalla, Zoe
  Leonard, and Carrie Yamaoka—continue to work together."
