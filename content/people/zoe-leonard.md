short_bio: New York-based artist **Zoe Leonard** balances rigorous conceptualism
  with a distinctly personal vision in her work, which merges photography,
  sculpture, and installation. By employing strategies of repetition, shifting
  perspectives, and a multitude of printing processes, Leonardâ€™s practice probes
  the politics of representation and display. Leonard explores themes such as
  gender and sexuality, loss and mourning, migration, displacement, and the
  urban landscape. Her photography specifically invites us to contemplate the
  role that the medium plays in constructing history, and to consider the roots
  of contemporary photographic culture.
