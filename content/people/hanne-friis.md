short_bio: "**Hanne Friis** (b. 1972) is an Oslo-based artist and is considered
  one of the most influential Norwegian contemporary artists working with
  textiles today. In her hand-sewn sculptures, Friis utilizes natural and
  synthetic fabrics to create amorphous, intricately patterned forms that evoke
  themes of growth and decay. She has exhibited worldwide, including a major
  solo exhibition at the Vigeland Museum in Oslo, Norway, and most recently, a
  major installation at the KODE Museum in Bergen. She is exhibiting in the U.S.
  for the first time this fall in a two-person show with Lynda Benglis at Locks
  Gallery in Philadelphia. "
