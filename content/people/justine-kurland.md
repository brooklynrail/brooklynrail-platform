short_bio: "**Justine Kurland** is an artist known for her utopian photographs
  of American landscapes and the fringe communities, both real and imagined,
  that inhabit them. Her early work comprises photographs, taken during many
  cross-country road trips, that counter the masculinist mythology of the
  American landscape, offering a radical female imaginary in its place. Her
  recent series of collages, SCUMB Manifesto, continues to make space for women
  by transforming books by canonized male photographers into a new feminist
  form. Kurlandâ€™s work has been exhibited at museums and galleries in the United
  States and abroad. Her work is included in permanent collections of the Museum
  of Modern Art, New York; Getty Museum, California; and the Museum of Fine
  Arts, Montreal, among others."
