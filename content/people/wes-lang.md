short_bio: Artist **Wes Lang** was born in Chatham, New Jersey in 1972. Many of
  the artist's influences are a function of a distinct autobiographical
  experience with certain exceptions; the Indigenous American as well as other
  totems of the American West, and painters and sculptors from middle of last
  century such as Twombly, Guston, Kline, Mitchell, and Bacon dovetailing on up
  to the more contemporary such as Basquiat, Kippenberger, and Mike Kelley. In
  2014, Lang made his institutional debut with \"The Studio\" @ aRoS Aarhus Museum
  of Art. His pieces are included in many notable international collections
  including MOMA and Murderme and is represented worldwide by Almine Rech. Lang
  currently lives and works in Los Angeles.
