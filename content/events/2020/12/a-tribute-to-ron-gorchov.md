  - person: odili-donald-odita
    event_bio: Odili Donald Odita (b. Engu, Nigeria in 1966; lives and works in
      Philadelphia, PA) is an abstract painter whose work explores color both in
      the figurative historical context and in the sociopolitical sense. He is
      best known for his large-scale canvases with kaleidoscopic patterns and
      vibrant hues, which he uses to reflect the human condition.For Odita,
      color in itself has the possibility of mirroring the complexity of the
      world as much as it has the potential for being distinct. In his
      paintings, we see color interwoven and mixed, becoming an active agent in
      representing the essential power that light has in identifying the
      entirety of our world. He thinks of his colors as agents to express
      thoughts, ideas, and transformational change. Much of his color selection
      is based on personal memories and created intuitively by hand-mixing, so
      that no two shades are ever repeated.

  - person: ray-smith
    event_bio: Painter and sculptor Ray Smith was born in Brownsville, Texas in
      1959, on lands that his family had settled in the early 19th century. He
      studied fresco painting with traditional craftsmen in Mexico, attended art
      academies in Mexico and the United States, and settled in Mexico City.
      Since 1985, he has divided his time between New York and Cuernavaca,
      Mexico. Smith’s work is characterized by a unique kind of magical realism.
      He bends, twists, and transplants, creating illogical scenarios that are
      full of surprises and special effects. The artist often uses dogs and
      animals as anthropomorphic beings. “They are an entity of the human
      figure,” says Smith. “They are beasts, but they are directly attached to a
      blueprint of our own existence.”

{{< image media="2020/12/ron-gorchov" size="lg" >}}

**Ron Gorchov,** born in Chicago in 1930, was an American artist who began working with curved surface paintings in 1967. He created his first shaped canvas work in Mark Rothko’s studio. Gorchov was best known for helping to spearhead the shaped canvas movement with his bowed wooden frames, resembling saddles or shields, stretched with linen or canvas and marked with simple shapes of thin paint providing chromatic contrasts. As part of a group of artists in New York in the 1960s and ‘70s including Frank Stella, Richard Tuttle, Blinky Palermo, and Ellsworth Kelly, Gorchov pushed painting to its extreme, defying Greenbergian formalism. Becoming a sort of hybrid between painting and sculpture, the warped edges of Gorchov’s canvases created new dimensions and depth, disorienting the viewer’s perception.
