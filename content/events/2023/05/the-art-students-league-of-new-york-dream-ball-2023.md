**History of the Dream Ball:** Started in the 1920s, the Dream Ball quickly became a legendary annual event in
NYC to raise funds for the school's scholarship program. Originally held at the Waldorf Astoria and Plaza Hotel the event was renowned as a place where high society partied with the radical artists of the League in a bacchanal inspired by themes ranging from “gods and goddesses of the Greek Pantheon” to a celebration of “The World’s Most Famous Sinners.” Each year, a Queen of the Ball was presented to the partygoers on a float. Former Ball Queens included Deborah Kerr and Anita Eckberg.
