short_bio: "**John Houck** is an American multi-disciplinary artist whose work
  is held in the collections of The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York;
  the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; The Hammer Museum, Los Angeles;
  Guggenheim Museum, New York, amongst other institutions. He is a graduate of
  the Whitney ISP, Skowhegan, and UCLA's MFA program. Central to Houck's
  practice is how shadows serve as signatures of both the condition and the
  limits of our experience. From subtly folded and rephotographed monochromatic
  papers, to paintings of psychological landscapes overlaid by personal objects,
  Houck recasts the shadow as a hinge of illusion and illumination, as the point
  at which what is real overlaps with what we can know and what we can imagine."
