short_bio: "**Julia Blandâ€™s** geometric compositions are created through a
  cyclical approach to assembly and dis-assembly.  By weaving, dying, sewing,
  burning and painting, the surface becomes a visible record of her evolving,
  multifaceted process. Within this rhythm of making and unmaking, bland
  develops the structures, symbols, and patterns that bind disparate elements
  into a whole.  Bland (b. Palo Alto, CA) lives and works in Brooklyn, NY.  She
  holds a BFA from RISD and a MFA from the Yale School of Art.  Her current solo
  exhibition _Rivers on the Inside_ will be on view at Derek Eller Gallery from
  April 25-May 25, 2024.  "
