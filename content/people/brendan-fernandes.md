short_bio: "Internationally recognized Canadian artist **Brendan Fernandes** (b.
  1979, Nairobi, Kenya) works at the intersection of dance and visual arts.
  Brendan’s projects address issues of race, queer culture, migration, protest
  and other forms of collective movement. Brendan’s projects take on hybrid
  forms: part ballet, part queer dance party, part politic protest, but always
  rooted in collaboration and solidarity. Brendan has received the Artadia Award
  (2019), a Smithsonian Artist Research Fellowship (2020) and a Louis Comfort
  Tiffany Foundation grant (2019). His projects have shown at the 2019 Whitney
  Biennial (New York) and the Guggenheim Museum (New York) among many others. He
  is currently Assistant Professor in the Department of Art Theory and Practice
  at Northwestern University."
