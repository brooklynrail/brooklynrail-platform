short_bio: An artist whose multidisciplinary works often use public spaces as
  well as converse with the literary. Many of his works use language, book
  pages, and appropriated narratives as material. He has had numerous group and
  solo gallery shows, including at Charlie James Gallery, LA Louver, and
  Rosamund Felsen, the Portland Art Museum, the Laguna Art Museum, Bemis Center
  for Contemporary Art, and Printed Matter, among others. 100 Walkers, West
  Hollywood, commissioned by The City of West Hollywood for its thirtieth year
  celebrations, won a Year in Review Award from Americans for the Arts/Public
  Art Network. Kraft was born and raised in London and now lives in Los Angeles
  and New York.
