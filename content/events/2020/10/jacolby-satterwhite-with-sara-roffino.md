  - person: jacolby-satterwhite
    event_bio: Jacolby Satterwhite was born in 1986 in Columbia, South Carolina and
      currently lives and works in Brooklyn. Jacolby Satterwhite is celebrated
      for a conceptual practice addressing crucial themes of labor, consumption,
      carnality and fantasy through immersive installation, virtual reality and
      digital media. He uses a range of software to produce intricately detailed
      animations and live action film of real and imagined worlds populated by
      the avatars of artists and friends. These animations serve as the stage on
      which the artist synthesizes the multiple disciplines that encompass his
      practice, namely illustration, performance, painting, sculpture,
      photography and writing. Satterwhite draws from an extensive set of
      references, guided by queer theory, modernism and video game language to
      challenge conventions of Western art through a personal and political
      lens. An equally significant influence is that of his late mother,
      Patricia Satterwhite, whose ethereal vocals and diagrams for visionary
      household products and ethereal vocals serve as the source material within
      a decidedly complex structure of memory and mythology.
