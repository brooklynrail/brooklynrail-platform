short_bio: "**Elaine Reichek** lives and works in New York. She received a BA
  from Brooklyn College and a BFA from Yale University, and has exhibited
  extensively in the US and abroad, with solo exhibitions at Secession, Vienna;
  The Jewish Museum, New York; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; and
  elsewhere. Thread has been a core element in Reichekâ€™s work since the early
  1970s, and she was a pioneer among her generation in rethinking the role of
  craft in the fine arts. Recent solo shows include _MATERIAL GIRL_ at Marinaro,
  New York (2022), and _Between the Needle and the Book_ at McClain Gallery,
  Houston (2020). Her next solo exhibition will be at Shoshana Wayne Gallery in
  Los Angeles in June 2023."
