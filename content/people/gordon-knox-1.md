short_bio: "**Gordon Knox** is a cultural innovator, institution builder,
  educator and arts-program designer. Gordon has envisioned and established
  groups, residencies and institutions that support exploratory artists and
  thinkers from across cultures and disciplines. Believing that humans are
  social beings, and that culture is the result of their interactions, he builds
  organizations grounded on interdependence and recognition. The models for
  these organizations often emerge from familiar forms of human assembly: the
  home, shared meals, forums for the exchange of ideas, and institutions that
  encourage collective efforts. His projects aim to make real an environment
  where thoughtful investigation, innovative thinking and shared values become a
  healthy matrix for cultural evolution."
