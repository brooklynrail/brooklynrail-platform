short_bio: "Born in NYC in 1963 to a Radio City Rockette and a concert
  violinist. From the roots of the downtown scene he emerged with Medeski Martin
  and Wood, bridging the harmonic complexity of jazz, the conversational fluency
  of free improvisation, and the groove and swagger of classic R&B and funk.
  Martin is also an accomplished filmmaker and visual artist, whose work has
  been exhibited in solo and group installations around the world including
  2014â€™s Cartegena de indias Bienal in Colombia and the Drawing Sound series at
  The Drawing Center in NYC (2015). Billy is currently Executive Artistic
  Director and CEO of the legendary Creative Music Studio. He also owns and
  manages his own record label Amulet Records. "
