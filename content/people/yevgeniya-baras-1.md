short_bio: "**Yevgeniya Baras** is an artist based in New York. Her paintings
  take shape through a process of layering and accumulation, combining oil media
  with various found and unconventional materials. The resulting objects hover
  between painting and sculptural relief, with layers that frequently extend
  onto the sides and supports of the canvas, refusing any definitive boundary.
  Within these stratified compositions, Baras creates symbolic topographies
  which address ideas of language, migration, and translation. She has exhibited
  her work widely throughout the U.S. and internationally, and is the recipient
  of recognitions including, the Pollock-Krasner grant (2023) and the Guggenheim
  Fellowship (2019)."
