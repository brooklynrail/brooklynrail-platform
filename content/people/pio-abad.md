last_name: Abad
short_bio: "**Pio Abad** is a London-based artist whose wide-ranging work mines
  alternative or repressed histories and offers counternarratives that draw out
  threads of complicity and entanglements between and within objects, incidents,
  ideologies, and people. Deeply informed by unfolding events in the
  Philippines, where the artist was born and raised, his work emanates from the
  personal and familial woven into the political and national. Abad has
  exhibited at the 58th Carnegie International; the 5th Kochi-Muziris Biennial;
  Ateneo Art Gallery, Manila; and elsewhere. Abad’s works are part of a number
  of important collections including Tate, UK and Hawai’i State Art Museum,
  Honolulu. Abad is also the curator of the estate of his aunt, Filipino
  American artist Pacita Abad."
