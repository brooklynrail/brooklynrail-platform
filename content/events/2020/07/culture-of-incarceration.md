  - person: rontherin-ratliff
    event_bio: Rontherin Ratliff is a mixed media sculptor whose work focuses on
      ideas of balance and the human condition. He blends functionality,
      aesthetic, context, and associations to address subjects of loneliness,
      loss, homesickness, memory, and the burdens we carry. Ratliff examines the
      metaphor of the body as a house where the mind dwells. Feeling at home or
      in harmony within including home as one's origin or domestic place. The
      work questions the sociocultural constructed concepts of self. With it, he
      contemplates reservations regarding home as a safe-haven where one
      experiences positive qualities such as security and comfort. Using
      architectural materials and domestic objects, his work explores the notion
      of internal versus external balance.

    event_bio: "Keith Calhoun and Chandra McCormick were born and raised in the
      lower ninth ward of New Orleans, Louisiana. As a husband and wife team,
      they have been documenting Louisiana and its people for more than 25
      years. In New Orleans, they have documented the music culture, which
      consists of Brass Bands, Jazz Funerals, Social and Pleasure Clubs,
      Benevolent Societies, and the Black Mardi Gras Indians. In addition to
      documenting New Orleans' social and cultural history, Calhoun and
      McCormick have also covered religious and spiritual ceremonies throughout
      their community, as well as river baptisms in rural Louisiana. They have
      created several photographic series, including Louisiana Laborers; The
      Dock Worker, Longshoreman, and Freight Handlers on the docks of New
      Orleans; Sugar Cane Field Scrappers in the river parishes along the
      Mississippi river; Cotton Gins, and Sweet Potato Workers in East Carrol
      parish of Lake Providence Louisiana. Calhoun and McCormick have documented
      the soul of New Orleans and a vanishing Louisiana: the last of the sugar
      cane workers, the dockworkers, the sweet potato harvesters, and the
      displacement of African Americans after Katrina. They photograph the
      traditions of black church services and religious rituals; community rites
      and celebrations, such as parades, and jazz funerals; and the cruel
      conditions of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, a former
      slave-breeding plantation named for the African nation from which “the
      most profitable” slaves, according to slave owners, were kidnapped."

***Chandra McCormick & Keith Calhoun: Slavery-The Prison Industrial Complex*** is an ongoing series of photographs of African-American life within the Louisiana prison system that reached global audiences with Prospect.3 New Orleans and the 56th Venice Biennale. Their investigation, which began in the 1980s, probes the hidden realities of the state prison system and depicts scenes of forced labor, art fairs, rodeo pageantry, and familial visits all set within prison walls.

***Per(Sister): Incarcerated Women of Louisiana***, the current Ford Foundation exhibition, explores one of the most critical issues of inequality and injustice facing our nation today through the lens of a population too often overlooked. With an alarming rise in rates of female incarceration, this exhibition seeks to build awareness of the crucial issues that impact women before, during, and after incarceration. The exhibition presents works from more than 30 artists who created new pieces based on the personal stories of 30 formerly and currently incarcerated women: *persisters*. Stories of loss, hope, despair, survival, triumph, and persistence are shared in a variety of forms, demonstrating simultaneously the universal struggles faced by communities impacted by incarceration and the personal resilience of each woman featured. 

This conversation crosses time and exhibitions to foreground a culture of incarceration, those whom it impacts most intimately, and the artists who tell their stories.
