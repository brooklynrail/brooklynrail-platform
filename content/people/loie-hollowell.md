short_bio: "**Loie Hollowell** was born in 1983 in Woodland, California, and
  lives and works in New York, New York. She received a BFA from University of
  California, Santa Barbara, and an MFA from Virginia Commonwealth University.
  Existing between abstraction and representation, Hollowell’s vibrant and
  evocative paintings refer to human bodies as sites of sensuality and
  sexuality, desire and disgust, pleasure and pain. Originating in
  autobiography, her work explores themes of sexuality, pregnancy and birth. In
  referencing her own personal experiences, Hollowell’s paintings are at once
  personal and universal in their fierce vulnerability. Her use of symmetry –
  often anchoring her compositions in a central, singular axis – relates her
  paintings to her own body as well as the natural world."
