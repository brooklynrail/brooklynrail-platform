    event_bio: "Over the course of almost two decades, Rico Gatson has become
      celebrated for his confrontational and politically opinionated artworks,
      often based on significant moments in black history. Images of riots,
      fires, and confinement pervade his works, which have touched on a range of
      subjects like the Watts Riots, the presidential election of Barack Obama,
      and the formation of the Black Panthers. As Gatson once said: “I’m always
      interested in seducing the viewer and then hitting them on the way out,
      allowing a delayed response to powerfully charged content.” Even though he
      uses painting, video, sculpture and installation, Gatson prefers not to be
      defined by any single medium, rather thinking of himself as an object
      maker inspired by Conceptualism and Performance Art."
