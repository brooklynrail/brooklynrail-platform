short_bio: "**Jessica Farrell** is a painter who grew up in the Midwest. She
  spent her early adulthood living in New York City and working in commercial
  photography. In 1989, Farrell moved to a small hamlet in the Catskill
  Mountains. For twenty years, she partnered with her husband, creating hundreds
  of pieces of obsessive art furniture from natural materials. Her recent
  paintings explore the people and places in her community. In addition to her
  art practice, Farrell manages the David Byrd Catalogue Raisonn√©. Knowing Byrd
  inspired her to create paintings about her family, mental illness, and peer
  recovery advocates in her community."
