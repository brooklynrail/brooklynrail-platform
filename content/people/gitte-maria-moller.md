short_bio: "**Gitte Maria Möller** received her BAFA from the Michaelis School
  of Fine Art in 2015. She lives and works in Cape Town, South Africa and has
  exhibited extensively locally and internationally. Gitte uses a range of
  different mediums and painterly devices to explore the symbolic and numinous
  possibilities of picture-making. Drawing from religious painting, dream
  symbology, early video games, online fan art and references to childhood,
  Gitte’s work holds a complex array of signs, symbols, and archetypes in
  suspension. Through a solitary game of exquisite corpse, fragments of
  discarded and disregarded aesthetics are rehabilitated by way of exaggerated
  symbolism to give expression to issues concerning the soul, femininity, and
  fear. "
