      Jeffrey Gibson’s multimedia practice synthesizes the cultural and artistic
      traditions of his Cherokee and Choctaw heritage with the visual languages
      of Modernism and themes from contemporary popular and queer culture. His
      work is a vibrant call for queer and Indigenous empowerment, envisioning a
      celebration of strength and joy within these communities.


      Jeffrey Gibson (b. 1972, Colorado Springs, CO) grew up in major urban centers in the United States, Germany, Korea, and England. He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1995 and Master of Arts in painting at the Royal College of Art, London, in 1998. He is a citizen of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and is half Cherokee. He is currently an artist-in-residence at Bard College and lives and works near Hudson, New York.

    event_bio: Paul Ramírez Jonas was born in Pomona, California in 1965 and raised
      in Honduras. Educated at Brown University (BA, 1987) and Rhode Island
      School of Design (MFA, 1989), Ramírez Jonas, currently lives and works in
      Brooklyn. Over the last twenty-five years Ramírez Jonas has created works
      that range from large-scale public installations and monumental sculptures
      to intimate drawings, performances and videos. Through his practice he
      seeks to challenge definitions of art and the public, engineering active
      audience participation and exchange. For example, his 2010 Creative Time
      project, ‘Key to the City,’ involved 20,000 participants and centered
      around a key as a vehicle for exploring social contracts pertaining to
      trust, access, and belonging. Keys have featured repeatedly in his work as
      symbols of access and exclusion as well as public and private ownership.
      Multiples based on everyday objects such as coins also are a reoccurring
      motif, allowing the artist to question notions of value, circulation, and
      societal rituals or behaviors. He is currently an Associate Professor at
      Hunter College, where he has been since 2007, and is represented Galeria
      Nara Roesler.

    event_bio: Xaviera Simmons’s body of work spans photography, performance, video,
      sound, sculpture and installation. She defines her studio practice, which
      is rooted in an ongoing investigation of experience, memory, abstraction,
      present and future histories-specifically shifting notions surrounding
      landscape-as cyclical rather than linear. In other words, Simmons is
      committed equally to the examination of different artistic modes and
      processes; for example, she may dedicate part of a year to photography,
      another part to performance, and other parts to installation, video, and
      sound works-keeping her practice in constant and consistent rotation,
      shift, and engagement.

In this turbulent moment when we find ourselves reevaluating American identity and values, the ***MONUMENTS NOW*** exhibition at [Socrates Sculpture Park](https://socratessculpturepark.org/monuments-now/) seeks to address the role of monuments in society and commemorate underrepresented narratives such as diasporic, Indigenous, and queer histories.

*MONUMENTS NOW* evolves over three cumulative parts. Part I opens opens summer 2020 with major new commissions for contemporary monuments by acclaimed artists [Jeffrey Gibson](https://socratessculpturepark.org/artist/jeffrey-gibson/), [Paul Ramírez Jonas](https://socratessculpturepark.org/artist/paul-ramirez-jonas/), and [Xaviera Simmons](https://socratessculpturepark.org/artist/xaviera-simmons/). Then Part II and Part III of the exhibition open together on October 10, 2020. Part II encompasses ten monument sculptures by the Park’s 2020 Artist Fellows and Part III features a multi-faceted monument project collectively realized by high school students. All three parts of the exhibition remain on view through March 2021.

In response to *MONUMENTS NOW*, the Park’s Broadway Billboard will also feature a monuments-related artwork by artist [Nona Faustine](https://socratessculpturepark.org/exhibition/billboard-faustine/). Furthermore, in acknowledgment of how monuments are shaped by society as well as by artists, the public is invited to share their reactions on-site and online over the course of the exhibition.

The exhibition will be documented in an artist-focused publication made possible by the Henry Luce Foundation.

*MONUMENTS NOW* is organized by Socrates Sculpture Park and curated by Jess Wilcox, Socrates Curator & Director of Exhibitions.
