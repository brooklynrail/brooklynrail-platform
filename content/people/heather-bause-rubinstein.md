short_bio: Until recently, **Heather Bause Rubinstein’s** painting practice
  centered on large scale textile works, ranging from unstretched recto/verso
  canvases to sewn works such as _The Clockwork,_ an immersive installation
  included in the 2023 International Triennial of Tapestry at the Central Museum
  of Textiles in Łódź, Poland. Informed by her study of historical land use,
  migration and the nomadic cultures of Central Asia, these works transpose and
  transform their materials into patterns of meaning. Recently, she has returned
  to oil and canvas, creating gestural abstractions that draw on influences as
  diverse as Vuillard and Twombly, while registering the complexity of the
  natural world amid the tragedy of climate change. She divides her time between
  New York City and the Catskills.
