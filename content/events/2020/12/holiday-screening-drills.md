    event_bio: Sarah Friedland is a filmmaker and choreographer working at the
      intersection of moving images and moving bodies. Through hybrid,
      narrative, and experimental filmmaking, multi-channel video installation,
      and site-specific live dance performance, she stages and scripts bodies
      and cameras in concert with one another to elucidate and distill the
      undetected, embodied patterns of social life and the body politic.
      Facilitating a research process integrating found movements, gestures, and
      postures from cinema and archival footage, embodied memories, and
      contemporary dance languages, she choreographs through practices of
      interviewing, pre- and re-enactment, adaptation, and improvisational play,
      shaping dances with diverse communities of performers and movers—from
      professional dancers to cohorts of seniors and teenagers. Her work has
      been presented in numerous film festivals and cinemas including New York
      Film Festival, New Directors/New Films, Ann Arbor Film Festival, New
      Orleans Film Festival, BAMcinématek, and Anthology Film Archives, in art
      spaces such as Performa 19 Biennial, La MaMa Galleria, Sharjah Art
      Foundation, MAM Rio, Wassaic Project, and Manifattura delle Arti, and in
      dance spaces including the American Dance Festival and Dixon Place. Her
      work has been supported by the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, Film at
      Lincoln Center, Dance Films Association, Rhode Island State Council of the
      Arts, NYSCA/Wave Farm, and Berlinale Talents, among others. Sarah
      graduated from Brown University's department of Modern Culture and Media
      and started her career assisting filmmakers including Steve McQueen, Mike
      S. Ryan, and Kelly Reichardt. Sarah has worked on collaborative research
      and writing projects with media theorists Wendy Chun on slut-shaming and
      new media leaks, with Erin Brannigan on the dancing body on film, and has
      an ongoing collaboration with writer, scholar, and programmer Tess
      Takahashi on masses and embodiment. She has taught workshops on dance film
      and been a guest artist at Brown, Yale, Skidmore, NYU Florence, and
      UnionDocs, among others, and is currently completing the AIM Emerging
      Artist Fellowship at The Bronx Museum.
