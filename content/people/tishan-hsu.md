short_bio: Since the mid-1980s, Tishan Hsuâ€™s prescient artistic practice has
  been probing the cognitive as well as physical effects of transformative
  technological advances on our lives. Through the use of unusual materials,
  software tools, and innovative fabrication techniques, his enigmatic paintings
  and sculptures explore and manifest poetic new ways to engage and reimagine
  the human body. Hsu has been making the majority of his paintings on canvas
  since the late 80s using a silkscreen process to juxtapose images of his
  close-up pastel drawings of flesh with appropriated biomedical images of
  orifices and body parts. His most recent paintings, further, almost announce
  their techno-mediation through an evident digital reproducibility.
