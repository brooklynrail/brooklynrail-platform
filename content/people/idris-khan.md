short_bio: London-based artist **Idris Khan** has received international acclaim
  for his minimal, emotionally charged photographs, videos, and sculptures.
  Drawing on diverse cultural sources, including literature, history, art,
  music, and religion, Khan has developed a unique narrative involving densely
  layered imagery that inhabits the space between abstraction and figuration and
  speaks to the themes of history, cumulative experience, and the metaphysical
  collapse of time into single moments. Khan’s first major museum exhibition in
  the US is currently at the Milwaukee Art Museum. He has also had solo
  exhibitions at many international venues and was appointed an OBE for services
  to Art in the Queen’s Birthday 2017 Honors List.
