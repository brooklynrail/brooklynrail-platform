    event_bio: "Born in Lahore, Pakistan, Shahzia Sikander received her BFA in 1991
      from the National College of Arts, Lahore, Pakistan, where she underwent
      rigorous training under master miniaturist Bashir Ahmed. The first student
      Ahmed invited to teach alongside him, she subsequently became the first
      artist from the Miniature Painting Department at the NCA to challenge the
      medium’s technical and aesthetic framework. Sikander’s breakthrough work,
      The Scroll (1989-90), received national critical acclaim in Pakistan,
      winning the prestigious Shakir Ali and Haji Sharif awards for excellence
      in miniature painting and launching the medium into the forefront of the
      NCA’s program. Sikander moved to the United States in 1993 to pursue her
      MFA at the Rhode Island School of Design, which she completed in 1995.
      Pakistani-born and internationally recognized, Shahzia Sikander ’s
      pioneering practice takes classical Indo-Persian miniature painting as its
      point of departure and challenges the strict formal tropes of the genre by
      experimenting with scale and various forms of new media. Informed by South
      Asian, American, Feminist and Muslim perspectives, Sikander has developed
      a unique, critically charged approach to this time-honored medium –
      employing its continuous capacity for reinvention to interrogate ideas of
      language, trade and empire, and migration. "
