short_bio: "**Hương Ngo (Ngô Ngọc Hương, 吳玉香)** was born in Hong Kong, and works
  between France, Vietnam and the US. Having grown up as a refugee in the
  American South, she engages histories of colonialism and migration,
  particularly in relationship to language, structures of power, and ideologies.
  In 2016, she was awarded the Fulbright US Scholar Grant in Vietnam to realize
  a project, exhibited at DePaul Art Museum (2017), and continued through the
  Camargo Core Program (2018), that examines the colonial history of
  surveillance in Vietnam and the anti-colonial strategies of resistance
  vis-à-vis the activities of female organizers and liaisons. Her work has been
  exhibited worldwide at the MoMA, MCA Chicago, Nhà Sàn Collective, and Para
  Site."
