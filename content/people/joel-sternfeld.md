short_bio: "**Joel Sternfeld** is an artist-photographer whose work is concerned
  with utopic and dystopic possibilities of the American experience. Since the
  publication of his landmark study, _American Prospects_ in 1987 his work has
  maintained conceptual and political aspects, while being steeped in history,
  art history, landscape theory and attention to seasonal passage. It is a
  melancholic, funny and profound portrait of America. All his subsequent work
  expands the narrative possibilities of still photography primarily through an
  authored text. All of his books and works converse with each other and may be
  read as a collective whole. Sternfeld is the recipient of two Guggenheim
  Fellowships and spent a year in Italy on a Rome Prize. He teaches at Sarah
  Lawrence College."
