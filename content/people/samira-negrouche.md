  _Traces_ with choreographer Fatou Cissé. Her books include _À l’ombre de
  Grenade_ (Marty, 2003), _Le Jazz des oliviers_ (Le Tell, 2010), _Stations_
  (Chèvre-feuille étoilée, 2023) and _J’habite en movement_, (Barzakh, 2023).
  _The Olive-Trees' Jazz and Other poems_, translated by Marilyn Hacker
  (Pleiades Press, 2020) has been shortlisted for The Dereck Walcott Prize for
