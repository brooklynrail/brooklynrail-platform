    event_bio: Gil Batle was born and raised in San Francisco to Filipino parents,
      was in and out of five different California prisons over 20 years for
      fraud and forgery, and is now living on a small island in the Philippines.
      Batle’s self-taught drawing ability evolved behind bars into sophisticated
      and clandestine tattooing skills that protected him from murderous gang
      violence in prisons such as San Quentin, Chuckawalla, and Jamestown— the
      “Gladiator School,” as it’s known to the unfortunate cognoscenti. Where
      Bloods, Crips, and Aryan Brotherhood gang-bangers in racially segregated
      cell-blocks rule with intimidation and threat, Batle’s facility for
      drawing was considered magic by the murderers, drug dealers, and armed
      robbers whose stories he now recounts in minutely carved detail on fragile
      ostrich eggshells, each with an architecture of pictorial panels supported
      and separated by a fine lattice of chain-link fencing, razor-wire, or
      carved hand-cuffs. The violent men he knew, the sad mistakes that
      sometimes led to the incarceration of regular guys, the terrifying events
      he witnessed, and the bonds formed under the worst conditions all appear
      with precise detail on pristine eggshells, nature’s most perfect creation
      and the manifestation of life and birth.

      Raymond Materson is a self-taught artist known for miniature pictures that
      he sews from threads of unraveled socks. He came upon this approach to
      making art while serving a period of 7 years in prison. Faced with
      seemingly endless time, he remembered his childhood and how he watched his
      Grandmother sewing peacefully for hours. His initial sewing efforts
      required colored threads that he got from pulling apart his socks. He
      fashioned a round plastic stretcher by cutting off the top ring of a
      plastic jar with a toenail clipper and stretched cotton fabric from boxer
      shorts or handkerchiefs to sew on. He began by sewing sports patches for
      himself and other inmates. He has continued creating art since his release
      from prison over 25 years ago. 


      Materson has lectured extensively, worked as a drug abuse counselor, and has had numerous gallery shows as well as being exhibited in the New Museum of Contemporary Art, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, The Hudson River Museum, Baltimore’s American Visionary Art Museum, The American Folk Art Museum, and most recently at Christie’s in New York. His work has been featured in the New York Times, the Washington Post, Sports Illustrated, and numerous other publications and news shows. Materson’s remarkable life from drug addiction to prison and the discovery of his artistic talents was published in 2002 in Sins and Needles: A Story of Spiritual Mending. He was the first artist to receive the Innovators Combating Substance Abuse Award from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
