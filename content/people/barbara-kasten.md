short_bio: "**Barbara Kasten** lives and works in Chicago. Kasten’s practice
  centers an exploration of perception and materiality. Her photographic output
  has been essential to the last decade of multi-disciplinary work in sculpture,
  video, installation, and public art. These works continue to examine an
  object’s presence within both illusionistic and real space. Forms—designated
  by shadow, color, and the space between objects—oscillate between
  representation and abstraction. Her work has been exhibited across the United
  States and Europe. Most recently, Kasten was the subject of a solo exhibition
  at the Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Germany, which traveled to Sammlung Goetz.  Her
  work is featured in the collections of the MoMA, The Whitney Museum of
  American Art, and the Tate Modern, and many others."
