      continuing the lineage of downtown NYC counterculture, honoring an

      works internationally at Jazzfest Berlin, Crossing Borders Festival in the
      Hague, Enclave Festival (Mexico City), LaMaMa Galleria (NYC), The Kennedy

      time-based practice develops through ephemeral gestures that result in a
      corpus of text-based, visual and sound pieces. She’s the artistic director
      of diSONARE, an experimental editorial project from Mexico City. She
      recently co-founded Rizoma, a series of performance workshops led by an

    event_bio: Mary Norbert Körte is a poet, environmental activist, and teacher.
      She joined the Dominican Catholic Sisterhood in San Rafael, California at
      the age of 17. She earned BA and MA degrees in Latin, translating
      Virgil’s Georgics into iambic pentameter and studying classical texts. She
      left the Dominican order in 1968, and continued to publish poetry,
      participate in anti-war activism, and spearhead environmental protection
      projects—including the preservation of over 200 acres of old growth
      redwoods in Irmulco, where she moved in the 1970s. There, she served as
      Northern California Coordinator for Poets in the Schools, and taught in
      Coyote Valley’s reservation for the Pomo people and at Mendocino Community
      College. She still lives in a cabin she built herself, and writes nearly
      every day.
