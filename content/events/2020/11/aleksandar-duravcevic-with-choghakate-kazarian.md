      Aleksandar Duravcevic (born in Montenegro, 1970) studied in Cetinje and
      Florence, Italy, and holds an MFA from the Pratt Institute, New York. His
      body of work includes sculptures, drawings, photography, and paintings.
      Through them he explores identity and duality – across cultures, within
      history, and between life and death.


      Duravcevic received a New York Foundation for the Arts grant in 2005, and his work has been included in exhibitions at The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia, and MoMA PS1, New York. His work is part of the permanent collections at The Uffizi in Florence, The Brooklyn Museum, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. A native of Montenegro and its representative at the 56th Venice Biennale in 2015, he was included again as part of the 58th Venice Biennale in 2019 with the exhibition Artists Need to Create on the Same Scale that Society Has the Capacity to Destroy: Mare Nostru.

      Duravcevic lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.
