**Peter Brook** (b. 1925, London) has distinguished himself in theater, opera, cinema, and writing throughout his career. He directed his first play in London in 1943 and has since directed more than 70 productions in London, Paris, and New York. His work with the Royal Shakespeare Company includes *Love’s Labour’s Lost* (1946), *Measure for Measure* (1950), *Titus Andronicus* (1955), *King Lear* (1962), *Marat/Sade* (1964), *US* (1966), *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* (1970), and *Antony and Cleopatra* (1978). In 1971, he founded with Micheline Rozan the International Centre for Theatre Research in Paris and opened its permanent base in the Bouffes du Nord Theatre in 1974, where he has presented works such as *The Iks* (1975), *Conference of the Birds* (1979), *The Cherry Orchard* (1981), *The Tragedy of Carmen* (1981), and *The Mahabharata* (1985), and, most recently, *The Suit* (2012), *The Valley of Astonishment* (2014) and *Battlefield* (2015)—many of these in both French and English. Brook’s longstanding relationship to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where many of his productions have been seen in New York, dates back to the 1970s, when BAM presented his innovative rendering of *A Midsummer Night's Dream* with the Royal Shakespeare Company. As part of the 1987 Next Wave Festival, he presented the nine-hour, three-part Indian epic *The Mahabharata*, followed by Chekhov's *The Cherry Orchard* (1988), *The Man Who* (1995), *The Tragedy of Hamlet* (2001), *The Suit* (2013), and *Battlefield* (2016). He has directed operas at Covent Garden, the Metropolitan Opera House, the Bouffes du Nord, and the Aix-en-Provence Festival. Brook’s autobiography, *Threads of Time*, was published in 1998 and joins his other titles including *The Empty Space* (1968), *The Shifting Point* (1987), *There are no Secrets* (1993), *Evoking (and Forgetting) Shakespeare* (1999), and *The Quality of Mercy* (2014). His films include *Moderato Cantabile* (1959), *Lord of the Flies* (1963), *Marat/Sade* (1967), *Tell me Lies* (1967), *King Lear* (1969), *Meetings with Remarkable Men* (1976), *The Mahabharata* (1989), and *The Tragedy of Hamlet* (2002, TV).
