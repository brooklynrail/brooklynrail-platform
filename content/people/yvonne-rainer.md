short_bio: Dancer, choreographer, filmmaker, and writer. Rainer is one of the
  most influential artistic figures whose work has been foundational in dance,
  cinema, feminism, minimalism, conceptual art, and postmodernism. Rainer first
  came to prominence as a leading figure in the Judson Dance Theater movement, a
  loose collection of dancers and artists whose performances crossed fluidly
  between the fields of dance and visual art. By the early 70s she began to
  focus on producing experimental feature films. Over the next 25 years, Rainer
  produced a series of films that engaged with the most advanced theoretical
  thinking of the time while also grappling with issues of power, privilege, and
  inequality. In 2000, Rainer returned to choreography.
