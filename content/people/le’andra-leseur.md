short_bio: "**Le’Andra LeSeur** is an artist whose work delves into the
  celebration of Blackness, queerness, and femininity. Through her work, LeSeur
  seeks to dismantle systems of power and provide her audience with an
  opportunity to contemplate themes such as identity, grief, and how the
  experience of invisibility and debility exist within the frameworks of our
  day-to-day lives. LeSeur has received several notable awards including the
  Tulsa Artist Fellowship (2024-2026)and the Leslie-Lohman Museum Artists
  Fellowship (2019), among others. Her work has been shown in solo and group
  exhibitions at LMCC, NY; The Shed, NY; Atlanta Contemporary, A.I.R. Gallery,
  Brooklyn, and others. Her work is in the collection at The Whitney Museum of
  American Art."
