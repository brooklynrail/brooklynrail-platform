short_bio: "Haitian immigrant and longtime activist **Jean Montrevil** was
  targeted for 30 years by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for his
  activism. Montrevil was deported to Haiti in 2018 under the Trump
  administration but got a second chance in 2021, when Virginia Governor Ralph
  Northam granted him a pardon for two drug convictions from three decades
  earlier, which ICE had used as a pretext to deport him. In April 2023, a U.S.
  judge ruled Montrevil would not face deportation again. "
