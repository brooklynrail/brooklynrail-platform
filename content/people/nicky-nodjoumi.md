short_bio: Contemporary artist **Nicky Nodjoumi** (b. 1942, Kermanshah, Iran)
  has used painting as his primary medium while exploring the relationship
  between power and violence for over 40 years. Nodjoumi participated in Iran's
  political revolution and as a result was expelled from the country leading him
  to become a major driver in building a profound, political body of works
  taking social power structure and violence as its subject. Nodjoumi's works
  are in several prominent institutional collections worldwide, including the
  Metropolitan Museum of Art, the British Museum in London, Guggenheim Museum in
  Abu Dhabi, and elsewhere. Major exhibitions of the artistâ€™s work include those
  at the LA County Museum of Art (2018); Metropolitan Museum of Art (2015); and
  Cleveland Museum of Art (2014).
