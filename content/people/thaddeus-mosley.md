short_bio: "**Thaddeus Mosley** is a Pittsburgh-based artist whose monumental
  sculptures are crafted with the felled trees of Pittsburgh’s urban canopy, via
  the city’s Forestry Division. Using only a mallet and chisel, Mosley reworks
  salvaged timber into biomorphic forms. These “sculptural improvisations,” as
  he calls them, take cues from the modernist traditions of jazz. Mosley is the
  recipient of the 2022 Isamu Noguchi Award. His work has been exhibited and
  acquired by major museums and foundations since 1959, and his traveling solo
  exhibition _Forest,_ is currently on view at the Nasher Sculpture Center,
  Dallas. Mosley’s work is included in  _Inheritance_ at the Whitney Museum of
  American Art, on view through February 2024. "
