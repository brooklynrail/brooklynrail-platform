short_bio: Harminder Judge (b. 1982 Rotherham, UK) is an artist whose practice
  spans object making, performance and installation. Harminder’s work has
  engaged with many subjects, but there is a continuous exploration of portals,
  be it spiritual, political, or personal. His performance work has weaved
  Indian folklore and mysticism with bombastic western pop music and live color
  field painting; collided occult inspired dreamscapes with hazy laser
  penetrated reverse baptisms; and transported field recordings made in his
  family’s Gurdwara in Punjab across the world, and replayed them through a
  speaker lodged in his throat. Harminder won the 2011 Arts Foundation
  Fellowship Award in performance art and was recently included in
  Tomorrow:London at White Cube.
