short_bio: A Venezuelan Human Rights Lawyer turned independent curator, creative
  consultant, and program specialist at the Hirshhorn Museum. Her activism in
  Venezuela proved too dangerous, forcing her to move to the United States where
  she seeks political asylum, and dedicates herself to finding justice through
  though-provoking art and culture projects. R. Delgado has worked with the
  Smithsonian Institution, The Embassy of Spain, Times Square Arts, The Center
  for Book Arts NYC, MacArthur Fellow Mel Chin, and the Obama White House.
