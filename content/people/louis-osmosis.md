short_bio: "**Louis Osmosis** (b. 1996, Brooklyn, NY) is an interdisciplinary
  artist working primarily in sculpture, drawing, performance, and text. His
  practice revolves heavily around craft/manufacture, performative actions, and
  readymades, incorporating found objects and vernacular materials, from
  popsicle sticks to graphic t-shirts, and hornet nests to violins. Equally
  invested in reenactment and artistic production, Osmosis’s speculative
  approach to form reflects his ongoing “investigation into affected modes of
  aspiration and lack.” Osmosis received his BFA from the Cooper Union in 2018."
