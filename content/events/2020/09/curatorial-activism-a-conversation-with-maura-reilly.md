    event_bio: "Nur Sobers-Khan is the Lead Curator for South Asian Collections at
      the British Library, London, where she is responsible for curating a
      collection of books and manuscripts on the history of Islam in South Asia.
      Her current work focuses on dismantling the structures of colonial
      violence embedded in the curation and exhibition of these
      collections.  Most recently she has been involved in the efforts of the
      library’s Decolonising Working Group, which aims to reconfigure the
      interpretation of artworks on display in the public and staff areas of the
      building, calling attention to the histories of imperial and colonialist
      violence embedded in their description (or lack thereof).  Previous
      exhibitions include Qajar Women: Images of Women in 19th-century Iran,
      co-curated with Mounia Chekhab-Abudaya, which took place at the Museum of
      Islamic Art, Qatar and explored historical depictions of nonbinary gender
      identities in the context of canonical constructions of ‘Islamic art.’ She
      is currently Principle Investigator of the AHRC-funded research and
      digitisation project Two Centuries of Indian Print, and her research
      pivots around two questions at the moment: the role of the dispersal and
      removal of cultural heritage artifacts in South Asia under British
      colonialism as a contributing factor in shaping the emergence of Islamic
      reformism in the second half of the 19th century, and the transition from
      manuscript to print in the same period and its creation of new forms of
      reading and poetic improvisation through the circulation of texts on
      cosmology, dream interpretation and other genres of divinatory literature.
      She completed her BA and PhD in Oriental Studies at the University of
      Cambridge. "

Please join us for our third installment of *Common Ground* featuring artist **Patricia Cronin**, and curators **Cecilia Fajardo-Hill**, **Nur Sobers-Khan**, and **Jasmine Wahi** with **Maura Reilly** for a conversation on Curatorial Activism. We will close with a poetry reading by **Camilo Roldán.**

At the start of quarantine, the *Brooklyn Rail* asked how might we stay connected to each other in a time of self-isolation? Now we ask: How can we stay involved and engaged in upholding our civic responsibility to one another across communities? How can we deploy this community we have built through the *New Social Environment*—through hundreds of conversations and meals shared over the past six months—to mobilize daily action for grassroots movements, social justice and equity projects, and for the political good of our most marginalized communities across the nation? *Common Ground* will be taking over the *New Social Environment* Thursday 1pm slot—beginning immediately and continuing up to the presidential election—and will convene weekly on Thursdays at 1pm Eastern from Sept 3rd through Nov 5th.

We will close with a poetry reading by **Camilo Roldán.**
