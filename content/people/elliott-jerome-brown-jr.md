  at Fire Island Artist Residency and Abrons Art Center in New York, St. Roch
  Community Church in Louisiana, and Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture
  in Maine. He is a 2022 NYSCA/NYFA Artist Fellow in Photography and received
  the Rema Hort Mann Foundation Emerging Artist Grant in 2019. Brown received
  his BFA in Photography from New York University and is a Part-Time Lecturer in
  Photography at The New School. He is represented by Nicelle Beauchene in New
  York and is based throughout New York."
