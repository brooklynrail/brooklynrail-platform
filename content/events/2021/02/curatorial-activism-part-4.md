    event_bio: "University Reader in Modern and Contemporary Art Theory, Juan
      Vicente Aliaga is associated with the Faculty of Fine Arts at the
      Polytechnic University of Valencia. His research is centred around
      feminist, gender, and queer studies with special attention to cultural,
      artistic, and political representations of sexual diversity. His teaching
      has also focused on the key role played by micro-politics and the
      contribution of intercultural, postcolonial and decolonial studies. He is
      currently exploring three main research topics: _Feminist genealogies in
      Spanish art from the 1960s onwards, Cultural, artistic and visual presence
      and agency of sexual diversity in the world_, and _Critical revision of
      modern art from a gender and sexual perspective_. The first of these
      topics was addressed in the exhibition curated for MUSAC (León),
      _Genealogías feministas en el arte español: 1960-2010_ (2013); the second
      issue has been tackled in a book on the work of Lebanese artist Akram
      Zaatari, _The Uneasy Subject_ (Charta, Milan, 2011), and also in an
      exhibition held at both MUSAC in 2011 and MUAC (Mexico City, 2012). He has
      also curated an exhibition in 2009 entitled _Everywhere: Politics of
      Sexual Diversity in Art_ at CGAC, Santiago de Compostela. The third issue
      has involved curating an exhibition on the French photographer Claude
      Cahun held at the Jeu de Paume (Paris) and La Virreina, Centre de la
      Imatge (Barcelona) both in 2011, and at The Art Institute of Chicago in
      2012. As an outcome of this project, a book was published in France
      (_Claude Cahun_, ed. Hazan, Paris, 2011). Recently in 2020, he has curated
      an exhibition at IVAM (Valencia Institute of Modern Art) entitled _Moral
      Dis/Order: Art and Sexuality in Europe between the Wars_. "

    event_bio: "Dr Clare Barlow is a London-based curator. Her most recent project
      is _Being Human_, a new permanent gallery curated for the Wellcome
      Collection, London, which opened September 2019 and was shortlisted for
      the Arts + Heritage awards for “Best Permanent Exhibition of the Year”.
      Previously, Clare was the sole curator for _Queer British Art, 1861-1967_
      at Tate Britain in 2019, a major exhibition that marked the fiftieth
      anniversary of the partial decriminalization of sex between men in England
      and Wales. She co-wrote and edited the exhibition catalogue, _Queer
      British Art, 1861-1967_, now in its third edition. Clare has also worked
      on curatorial teams at Tate and the National Portrait Gallery, organizing
      shows and displays on a wide range of topics. She is now working as
      Curator of Exhibitions at the Science Museum in London, developing
      exhibitions for their major international touring program. Clare received
      her PhD from King’s College in London and her BA and MPhil at the
      University of Cambridge. Her doctoral thesis, titled _Eighteenth Century
      Women Writers in the Public Eye: Virtue, Patriotism and Publication_, was
      completed in 2010. She has published articles on a wide range of subjects,
      including queer art, disability studies and curatorial practice. Her
      overarching research focus as a curator is how to enact ethical approaches
      to inclusion in the museum and how museums can better engage with themes
      of social justice. "

      Jonathan D. Katz is perhaps the founding figure in queer art history,
      responsible for the very first queer scholarship on a number of artists
      beginning in the early 1990s. Recent projects include a study of the
      international influence of Herbert Marcuse’s writing on the visual arts
      from the 1950s to the 1970s, a new reading of the cultural wars in the era
      of AIDS and contemporary resonances of that conflict, a project
      envisioning supplanting the predominantly binary understanding of
      sexuality with a trans perspective, and new work on queer Latinx artists
      in periods of dictatorship. His 2010 exhibition _Hide/Seek: Difference and
      Desire in American Portraiture at the Smithsonian National Portrait
      Gallery_ won the 2011 award for best national museum exhibition by AICA
      and its catalog was awarded the best non-fiction queer text by the
      American Library Association. His recent exhibition _About Face:
      Stonewall, Revolt and New Queer Art_, was the largest queer exhibition yet
      mounted, with 500 works, and was favorably reviewed on the front page art
      section of the _New York Times_. His exhibition _Art, AIDS, America_
      traveled to five museums across the country. Katz has been a central
      figure in the establishment of the field of queer studies in the US, as
      the chair of the first such department in the US at City College of San
      Francisco, the first tenured faculty in the field, the founder of the
      first such program in the Ivy League at Yale University, and the first
      doctoral program in queer Visual Studies at the University at Buffalo. He
      has also founded and chaired several major non-profit and queer activist
      organizations.
