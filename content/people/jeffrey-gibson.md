short_bio: Based in Hudson NY, interdisciplinary artist **Jeffrey Gibson** is a
  member of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and of Cherokee descent.
  Raised in Europe, Asia and the United States, Gibson developed an interest in
  notions of cultural translations and the relationship between difference and
  desire. Remixing and redefining histories of struggle and freedom, his
  installations and performances especially cultivate shared social spaces of
  reflection and release. In 2024, he was the first Indigenous artist to
  represent the United States in a solo presentation at the Venice Biennale.
