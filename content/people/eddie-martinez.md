short_bio: Brooklyn-based artist Eddie Martinezâ€™s work joins together painting
  and drawing, abstraction and representation in non-traditional ways. Imbued
  with a sense of personal iconography, his practice often combines signature
  figurative elements, such as bug-eyed humans and eclectic headgear with
  gestural, abstract blocks of color.  His paintings employ an aggressive use of
  color and texture with various combinations of oil, enamel, spray paint and
  collage elements on canvas. Martinez also produces large and small-scale
  abstract sculpture, made mostly from found materials such as rubber hoses,
  Styrofoam, cardboard, and metal scraps sourced from wherever the artist is
  working at the time.
