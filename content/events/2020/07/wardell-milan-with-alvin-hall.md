    event_bio: Wardell Milan is a visual artist who makes works on paper, painting,
      mixed media, videos, and photographs. Milan combines drawing and
      photography in collages and three-dimensional dioramas. Milan sustains a
      thoughtful inquiry into the nature of beauty and the unconscious, touching
      on topics such as body modification and gender performance. His most
      recent series, Parisian Landscapes, explores the duality between
      marginalization and freedom of expression, imagining places where the
      marginalized body is able to express itself and move about the world
      freely. Milan studied photography at the University of Tennessee and Yale
      University. Milan lives and works in New York.
