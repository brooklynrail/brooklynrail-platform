short_bio: "Artist **Sarah Sense** is from Sacramento, California. Sense has
  been practicing photo-weaving with traditional basket techniques from her
  Chitimacha and Choctaw family since 2004. While director and curator of the
  American Indian Community House Gallery, New York, Sense catalogued the
  galleryâ€™s thirty-year history, inspiring her search for Indigenous art
  internationally. Her world travels were charged with archive research,
  photo-weaving project that expanded to community programming, international
  Indigenous artist interviews and a book, _Weaving the Americas._ Her most
  recent commissions for Florida State University (2021) and Amon Carter Museum,
  Fort Worth (2022) are large wall weaving of maps and documents from the
  British Library archive. "
