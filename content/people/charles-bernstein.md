short_bio: Charles Bernstein is a poet and a scholar. He is a foundational
  member and leading practitioner of Language poetry. Between 1978-1981, with
  fellow poet Bruce Andrews, he published L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E magazine, which became
  a forum for writing that blurred, confused, and denied the boundary between
  poetry and critical writing about poetry. Since the 1970s Bernstein has
  published dozens of books, including poetry and essay collections, pamphlets,
  translations, collaborations, and libretti. His poetry has been widely
  anthologized and translated, and it has appeared in over 500 magazines and
  periodicals. His most recent book is Near/Miss, from the University of Chicago
  Press.
