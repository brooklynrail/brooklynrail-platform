**Christie’s recent auction of a work on the blockchain increased speculation on the blockchain realm. Variously called crypto art, NFTs, and blockchain art, artists and galleries are embracing its potential. How does it work? Why does it work? Is it an art work or just a form of currency? What are the environmental concerns? Is it a way to help artists retain some fiscal control over their work? Is it just a tech bro scam? Join long-standing participants in the digital art realm for a discussion on why they have now decided to make this a part of their studio practice or to sell it through their galleries.**
