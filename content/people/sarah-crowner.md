short_bio: "Sarah Crowner was born in Philadelphia in 1974. She earned a BA from
  the University of California, Santa Cruz, and an MFA from Hunter College, City
  University of New York. In her search for a mode of image making that
  accommodates immediacy and spontaneity, Crowner creates graphic compositions
  that discretely test the boundaries of abstract painting while also engaging
  and reshaping its art historical legacy. From afar, the bold geometric forms,
  clean lines, and elegant arabesques inhabiting her canvases conjure the
  pristine visual fields of geometric abstraction. On closer viewing, the
  presence of stitches and seams reveals a craft-oriented methodology in which
  raw and painted segments of canvas are cut, rearranged, and sewn together
  using the process-based logic of collage. "
