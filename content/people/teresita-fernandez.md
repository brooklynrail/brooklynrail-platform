short_bio: "**Teresita Fernández’s** work is characterized by an expansive
  rethinking of what constitutes landscape: from the subterranean to the cosmic,
  from national borders, to the more elusive psychic landscapes we carry within.
  Fernández unravels the intimacies between matter, human beings, and locations,
  and her luminous work poetically challenges ideas about land and landscape by
  exposing the history of colonization and the inherent violence embedded in how
  we imagine and define place, and, by extension, one another. Fernández is a
  MacArthur Foundation Fellow and the recipient of numerous other awards. In
  2011, she was appointed by President Barack Obama to serve on the U.S.
  Commission of Fine Arts. Her work has been exhibited in renowned institutions
  nationally and internationally."
