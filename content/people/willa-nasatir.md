short_bio: "**Willa Nasatirâ€™s** practice investigates varied approaches to
  imaging. In both her paintings and photographs the artist transforms everyday
  objects to the point of the surreal, collecting and accumulating her subjects
  before distorting and abstracting their forms through various analog, drawing,
  and painting processes.  Through abstracted form, she plays with dualities of
  meaning and proposes an unraveling of perceived boundaries as they relate to
  gender and power.  She has had solo exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of
  American Art, New York; the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo; Ghebaly
  Gallery, Los Angeles; Gaylord Apartments, Los Angeles; Chapter NY, New York;
  and White Columns, New York."
