    event_bio: "Musa Mayer’s first book about her father, a memoir entitled ‘Night
      Studio’, was published in 1988 by Alfred A. Knopf and republished in a new
      edition in 2016 when Hauser & Wirth took over the representation of the
      Estate of Philip Guston from the McKee Gallery. Since Musa’s retirement
      from a twenty-five-year career as an acclaimed research and patient
      advocate for people living with advanced breast cancer, she has curated
      two exhibitions of Guston’s satirical Nixon drawings in New York and
      London, as well as a survey exhibition in Hong Kong, an exhibition of
      Guston’s work from 1971, and a recent online exhibition entitled 'What
      Endures’ during the summer of 2020. ‘Resilience’ is her third book with
      Hauser & Wirth Publishers. The second, ‘Philip Guston: Nixon Drawings 1971
      and 1975,’ coauthored with Debra Bricker Balken, was awarded the FILAF
      d’Or international prize as the best international art book of 2017. An
      upcoming small monograph on her father, published by Laurence King, will
      be released in late 2020 or early 2021. Besides managing the Estate of
      Philip Guston, Musa is President of The Guston Foundation. The most recent
      Foundation project is the newly launched website PhilipGuston.org  a
      comprehensive resource built around a Catalogue Raisonné of the paintings
      that allows users free access to museum collections, exhibitions and
      bibliography, as well as featuring an extensive chronology, scrapbook, and
      slideshows of diverse aspects of Guston’s art. "
