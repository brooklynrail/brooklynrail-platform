short_bio: Through her interdisciplinary practice, **Heather Hart** fuses
  fabricated and historical belief systems; legends that have been bequeathed
  through generations mixed with invention and intuition. She creates new
  rituals to empower the individual; in her words, she makes oracles. These
  works on paper depict a kind of enigmatic nature of a space, exploring
  inherited forms, the phenomenology of nostalgic architecture, and PTSD. There
  is a reference to power and imagining these narratives using it to tear the
  roof off, thus unearthing an idea of ‘home’ and also demonstrating a cosmic
  energy and explaining something inconceivable. Born in Seattle, WA, Hart lives
  and works in Brooklyn, NY.
