One of the Railâ€™s many idiosyncrasies is that we do not have an Editor-in-Chief; each of our editors has autonomy over their section.

If you are interested in submitting a pitch, press release, or manuscript, please direct it to the attention of the editor your piece would concern. You can view our masthead here, and you can contact all editors at [section]@brooklynrail.org, e.g. artseen@brooklynrail.org, dance@brooklynrail.org, etc.

Please note that our POETRY and FICTION sections do not accept unsolicited submissions.



We do not have a physical editorial office; our 253 36th St. location is an administrative headquarters, meaning that all editorial work is handled remotely. Please do not send hard copy press releases or submissions to our administrative headquarters; they will not reach their intended audience this way!
