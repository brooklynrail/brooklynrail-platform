short_bio: "Dame **Sonia Boyce** DBE RA (b. London, 1962) is an
  interdisciplinary artist and academic working across film, drawing,
  photography, print, sound, and installation. In 2022, she presented *FEELING
  HER WAY* for the British Pavilion at the 59th Venice Biennale for which she
  was awarded the Golden Lion for Best National Participation. Boyce came to
  prominence in the early 1980s as a key figure in the burgeoning British Black
  Arts Movement with figurative pastel drawings and photo collages that
  addressed issues of race and gender in Britain. Since the 1990s, Boyce has
  shifted significantly to embrace a social practice that invites improvisation,
  collaboration, movement, and sound with other people. "
