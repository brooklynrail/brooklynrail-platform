**Limor Tomer** has led The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Live Arts program for 8 years, during which time she completely transformed the program into a world leader in museum-based performance. As General Manager, Live Arts, she curates, commissions, produces, and presents groundbreaking performances, both in the Museum’s 700-seat auditorium and its galleries and public spaces. Performances reach over 100,000 visitors annually, over 500,000 online, and have garnered consistent critical and audience praise. She regularly gives presentations on museum-based performance art around the world and leads workshops with museums nationally and internationally. Limor holds two degrees from The Juilliard School and an Honorary Doctorate from Manhattan School of Music. She was honored by ETHEL, So Percussion, and ASCAP for her work in adventurous programming, she teaches Entrepreneurship in creative production at The New School, and serves on the National Curatorial Council of The Hermitage Artist Retreat.

**Mark Lubell** joined the International Center of Photography as executive director in November 2013. He was previously director of Magnum Photos (2004– 2011). He spearheaded the restructuring of Magnum, whose history is closely tied with the foundation of ICP, steering it into the 21st century and introducing new revenue streams in tune with today’s online marketplace. In 2007, American Photo named Lubell “Innovator of the Year” for his pioneering approach to multimedia and online communities. Beginning in 2008, he led "Access to Life," a project in which eight Magnum photographers documented the work of The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. It has successfully raised $1 billion to provide anti-retroviral medicines for HIV-positive people around the world. Prior to his work at Magnum, Lubell was chief operating officer of "Here is New York: A Democracy of Photographs," which was formed in the aftermath of the events of September 11, 2001. He was also a founding principal of software company Visual Edge Systems, Inc.

**Paul D. Miller, aka DJ Spooky,** is a composer, multimedia artist, and writer whose work immerses audiences in a blend of genres, global culture, and environmental and social issues. Miller has collaborated with an array of recording artists, including Metallica, Chuck D, Steve Reich, and Yoko Ono. His 2018 album, DJ Spooky Presents: Phantom Dancehall, debuted at #3 on Billboard Reggae.
