short_bio: "Based in Philadelphia, **Pony P. (Aimee)** is an artist and poet.
  Primarily working in fiber, sculpture, and installation, their work is a
  testament to interconnectivity and empathy, cultivated through the gestural
  potential of material and ritual. Their practice is largely informed by
  dreamwork, western esotericism, and art education. Current research topics
  are: hypnosis, Victorian consumption and fashion, nomadic architecture, and
  the relationship between insanity and divinity. They hold a BFA in Fibers from
  MICA and have since furthered their practice at Mt Lebanon Residency,
  Craigardan, Mildredâ€™s Lane, Fiberhouse Collective, and the Center for Deep
  Listening."
