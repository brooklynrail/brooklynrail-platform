short_bio: The New American Cinema Group (The Film-Makers' Cooperative) was
  founded in 1961 for the distribution of avant-garde film. It is the first
  artist-run organization devoted to the dissemination of moving image art.
  Artists and estates maintain creative control of their works as we are a
  non-contractual, non-exclusive, membership based, non-profit group. NACG is a
  research center for film scholars and media makers, a digitization and
  preservation center for all formats of moving image art. The Film-Makers'
  Cooperative ensure access to its collection via a screening room and digital
  streaming. They also foster the production of new art work via sponsorships
  and residencies.
