short_bio: An artist who lives in Brooklyn, New York, and is the founder and
  director of Pioneer Works, a multidisciplinary cultural center in Red Hook,
  Brooklyn that builds community through the arts and sciences to create an open
  and inspired world. In tandem to his institution-building social practice,
  Yellin’s artwork makes the hidden forces of nature and commerce legible.
  Drawing on both modernism, and the sacral tradition of Hinterglas painting,
  Yellin primarily works through a unique form of 3-dimensional photomontage, in
  which paint, and images clipped from various print media are embedded within
  laminated glass sheets to form grand pictographic allegories, which the artist
  calls “frozen cinema”. He holds an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the
  Savannah College of Art and Design.
