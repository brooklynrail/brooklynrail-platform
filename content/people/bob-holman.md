short_bio: Bob Holman is an American poet and poetry activist, most closely
  identified with the oral tradition, the spoken word, and poetry slam. As a
  promoter of poetry in many media, Holman has spent the last four decades
  working variously as an author, editor, publisher, performer, emcee of live
  events, director of theatrical productions, producer of films and television
  programs, record label executive, university professor, and archivist. He was
  described by Henry Louis Gates Jr. in The New Yorker as “the postmodern
  promoter who has done more to bring poetry to cafes and bars than anyone since
  Ferlinghetti.” Bob is a contributor of the Brooklyn Rail. His two new books,
  The Unspoken and Life Poem, were written 50 years apart. You can order them
  from YBK Publishers.
