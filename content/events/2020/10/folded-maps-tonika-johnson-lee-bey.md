    event_bio: "Tonika Lewis Johnson is a photographer, community organizer, and
      lifelong resident of Chicago’s South Side neighborhood of Englewood.
      Through her artistic practice, Johnson explores the legacy and lived
      reality of urban segregation in the city of Chicago, and documents the
      nuance and richness of Black life in her home community of Englewood. Her
      Folded Map project (2017–) visually investigates disparities among Chicago
      residents while also bringing residents into dialogue with one another
      across the divide of residential segregation. In the three years since its
      inception, Folded Map has been used as an educational, advocacy, and
      community organizing tool as well as a policy framework, and has continued
      to invite neighbors to open dialogue and question how we are all socially
      impacted by institutionalized racial conditions that aid in the
      segregation of our cities. Tonika Johnson was named a 2017 “Chicagoan of
      the Year” by Chicago magazine, for her photographic work documenting
      Englewood’s everyday beauty and countering the neighborhood’s pervasive
      media narrative of poverty and crime. She was named a 2019 “Leader for a
      New Chicago” by The Field Foundation of Illinois and was recently
      appointed a member of the Cultural Advisory Council of the Department of
      Cultural Affairs and Special Events by the Chicago City Council. As a
      community organizer and creative placemaker, Tonika Johnson helped cofound
      the Resident Association of Greater Englewood (RAGE) in 2010, which works
      to mobilize people and resources to sustain positive change in Englewood
      through solution-based approaches, and is a lead cofounder of the
      Englewood Arts Collective which works to reframe the narrative of
      Englewood through visual language and community outreach. Her work has
      been exhibited at Rootworks Gallery, the Chicago Cultural Center, Harold
      Washington Library, the Loyola University Museum of Art, among others. Her
      most recent work, Belonging: Power, Place, and Impossibilities, is
      currently on view virtually and by appointment at Chicago Justice Gallery.

Please join us for our sixth installment of Common Ground, with **Tonika Lewis Johnson**, photographer, educator, and lifelong resident of Chicago’s South Side neighborhood of Englewood, whose seminal work *Folded Map* (2017–) visually investigates the legacy and lived reality of urban segregation and economic disparity in Chicago while offering us a blueprint for another way to live in community together. She will be joined by special guest **Lee Bey**, architecture critic, community historian, and author of the book *[Southern Exposure: The Overlooked Architecture of Chicago’s South Side](https://nupress.northwestern.edu/content/southern-exposure)* (Northwestern University Press, 2019), a monograph which pays witness to the unsung architectural wonders of South Side neighborhoods, documenting heritage features largely absent from arts discourse by nature of sitting in historically Black neighborhoods.

Tune in for a conversation on cultural life in the South Side of Chicago, how segregation is baked into our cities, and how the curative for systemic disinvestment is shifting value back onto your own block. They will also discuss Johnson’s response to [Alec Soth’s photo essay commissioned by *The New York Times*](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/magnum-photographer-alec-soth-may-face-legal-action-after-plagiarism-claim-from-chicago-artist-tonika-johnson), why this infringement is emblematic of a broader problem of racism in media journalism, and her new project, *Belonging* which highlights the experiences of teenagers growing up in a system of policing and containment designed to keep them from traversing their own city as full citizens, and who still persist in creating spaces of belonging and sustenance. This conversation will be moderated by **Malvika Jolly**, and will close with a reading from poet and music journalist **I.S. Jones**.

#### **About this series**

At the start of quarantine, the *Brooklyn Rail* asked how might we stay connected to each other in a time of self-isolation? Now we ask: How can we stay involved and engaged in upholding our civic responsibility to one another across communities? How can we deploy this community built through the *New Social Environment*—through hundreds of conversations and meals shared over the past six months—to mobilize daily action for grassroots movements, social justice and equity projects, and for the political good of our most marginalized communities across the nation? Tune in Thursdays at 1pm for *Common Ground*, a new lunchtime series featuring weekly conversations with social justice practitioners, changemakers, and activists on how we can mobilize our daily actions to radically reimagine our democracy.

***Belonging: Power, Place, and (Im)Possibilities* is on view [virtually](http://belongingchicago.com/) and in-person by appointment at Chicago Justice Gallery.**
