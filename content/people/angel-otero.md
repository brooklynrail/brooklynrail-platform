short_bio: Born in 1981 in Santurce, Puerto Rico, **Angel Otero** received his
  MFA at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Otero’s practice is known
  for employing highly innovative techniques that challenge the parameters of
  his materials, revealing the intrinsic qualities of paint. His works are
  rooted in abstract image making and engage with ideas of memory through
  addressing art history, as well as his own lived experience. Otero is well
  known for the Oil Skin works he began in 2010, an ongoing series that
  demonstrates the transformative nature of the artist’s practice and his
  dedication to expanding the visual field of abstract expressionism. Otero’s
  work is in numerous collections, including the Berezdivin Collection, Puerto
  Rico and the Bronx Museum of the Arts.
