This summer, we are celebrating the sections of the *Brooklyn Rail* with conversations, performances, and readings curated by our editors. This 2-week YouTube video series offers a view behind the scenes with the editors, artists, and writers that make the publication.

On Monday, July 26, Dance editor Gillian Jakab is joined by *New York Times* dance critic and *Rail* contributor Siobhan Burke and *Rail* contributor Noa Weiss for a conversation on the state of dance criticism and how it has been affected throughout the pandemic.
