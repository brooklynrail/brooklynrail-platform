      intersectionality and visibility, entitled All The Women In Me Are Tired.

    event_bio: "Jaret Vadera is a transdisciplinary artist whose work examines how
      images colonize the ways that we see the worlds around and within us.
      Vadera hacks different visual systems, and rewires them to rupture,
      self-destruct, and open up parallel ways of seeing. His work is influenced
      by decolonial theory, science fiction, and the study of impossible
      objects. Vadera's prints, collages, sculptures, videos, and installations
      have been exhibited and screened internationally at venues such as: Queens
      Museum, MoMA, the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center, Asia Society,
      Aga Khan Museum, Bhau Daji Lad Museum, and the Maraya Art Centre. In
      parallel, Vadera has worked as a curator, programmer, and writer on
      projects that focus on art as a catalyst for cultural change. Vadera lives
      and works between the United States, Canada, and India. He is currently
      based in Brooklyn, New York."
