short_bio: "A trans, arab-american punk poet-performer cyborg, writing on the
  art of killing bros, the intricacies of cyborg bodies, trauma and delayed

  Street Press, 2019), is a poetic critique of the U.S. military’s role in the
  War on Terror. Simone White selected their second assemblage, Villainy for
  publication in September 2021 at Nightboat Books. With Kay Gabriel, they
  co-edited We Want It All: An Anthology of Radical Trans Poetics (Nightboat
  Books, 2020). They are a leo currently obsessed with queer terror and
