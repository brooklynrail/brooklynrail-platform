    event_bio: Elliott Puckette’s delicate and ethereal paintings are a continual
      exploration of the dynamic possibilities of the line. Evocative of written
      music and ancient script, her linear abstraction is rendered either by
      etching into the prepared ground with a razor blade or drawing
      meticulously with ink on an expanse of paper. Puckette received her BFA
      from Cooper Union in New York in 1989. Her works are included in the
      permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the New York
      Public Library, the Fogg Museum, and the Huntsville Museum of Art. She has
      been represented by Kasmin since 1993. Elliott was born in Lexington,
      Kentucky, and currently lives and works in Brooklyn, NY.

    event_bio: David Nolan founded David Nolan Gallery in 1987 in Soho, specializing
      in modern and contemporary works by an array of international artists
      working in a variety of media. The gallery’s original mission was to
      exhibit contemporary works on paper along with painting and sculptures by
      American and European artists, and to produce monographs together with
      tightly curated historical exhibitions. The first solo show at the gallery
      – an exhibition of early drawings by Sigmar Polke - was followed by
      presentations of now-canonical German artists, including Georg Baselitz,
      Martin Kippenberger, Dieter Roth, Gerhard Richter, Rosemarie Trockel and
      Albert Oehlen. In Spring 2020, the gallery announced its newest location
      on the Upper East Side in a historic townhouse built in 1902 by
      architectural firm Buchman and Fox, inaugurated with an exhibition of
      works on paper by Jorinde Voigt.

      All aspects of his activities, from publishing, writing, editing, curating, to art practice, including executing large-scale installation, making portraits of featured interviewees in the Rail and other forms of social activism are integral parts of his “social environment,” a consequential step following Joseph Beuys’s social sculpture and Nicholas Bourriaud’s relational aesthetics.
