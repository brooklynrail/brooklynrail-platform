This past October marked the Rail's 20th anniversary, so we're celebrating with our 201st episode of the Rail's New Social Environment! We're taking this opportunity to look back at what we've accomplished by inviting friends and colleagues to share a selection of texts, poems, music, and more that highlight the virtual odyssey of 2020.

Following an introduction by Rail Publisher & Artistic Director Phong H. Bui, Managing Director Sophia Pedlow and Managing Editor Charles Schultz will open with remarks, followed by readings from Rail staff and editors, including friends Henry Adeson, Candida Alvarez, Natasha Arora, Susan Bee, Nick Bennett, Anselm Berrigan, Serena Caffrey, John Cappetta, Juliette Cezzar, Lynn Crawford, Emily Dean, Bryan Doerries, Susan Firestone, Umberto Freddi, Adjua Gargi Nzgina Greaves, Susan Harris, EJ Hauser, Malvika Jolly, Deanna Lee, Helen Lee, Justin Levesque, Tom McGlynn, Cal McKeever, Yanique Norman, Rev. Dr. Donna Schaper, G.E. Schwartz, Roxanne Steinberg, Anne Waldman, McKenzie Wark, Jeremy Zilar, and more. 

Stay tuned for more details!
