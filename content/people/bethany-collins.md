short_bio: "**Bethany Collins** (b.1984) was born in Montgomery, AL and lives
  and works in Chicago, IL. Collins is a multidisciplinary artist whose
  conceptual practice examines the relationship between race and language.
  Centering language—its biases, contradictions, and ability to simultaneously
  forge connections and foster violence—her works illuminate America’s past and
  offer insight into the development of racial and national identities. Drawing
  on a wide variety of documents, ranging from nineteenth-century musical scores
  to US Department of Justice reports, she erases, obscures, excerpts, and
  rewrites portions of text to bring to the fore issues revolving around race,
  power, and histories of violence."
