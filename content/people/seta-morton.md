short_bio: "**Seta Morton** is an interdisciplinary performance curator, writer,
  and editor based in Lenapehoking (New York City). She is the Program Director
  and Associate Curator at Danspace Project and managing editor of Danspace’s
  digital and print publications. Informed by techniques of experimental dance
  artists, Seta has a curatorial practice grounded in embodiment, collaboration,
  open-ended inquiry, grace, and Black feminist thought (inspired by Zora Neale
  Hurston, bell hooks, Audre Lorde, Toni Morrison, Octavia Butler, and more).
  Morton has edited six Danspace Online Journal issues and three print
  catalogues to date. Seta’s own writing occupies spaces between iteration,
  fermentation, time travel, intergenerational memory and haunt."
