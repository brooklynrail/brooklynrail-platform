short_bio: "**Beverly Semmes**  shines a light on the paradoxes surrounding the
  representation of the female body in media and culture. The artist gained
  early recognition for her coded, large-scale fabric installations based on
  feminine garments. Her _Feminist Responsibility Project_ (FRP) furthers the
  ongoing debate engendered by the shifting politics of female sexuality. Semmes
  has been honored with many solo exhibitions, including the Hirshhorn Museum;
  the ICA Philadelphia; the Irish Museum of Modern Art; The Ginza Art Space,
  Tokyo; and the MCA Chicago. In fall 2025, her alma mater, Tufts University,
  will present a major solo exhibition. "
