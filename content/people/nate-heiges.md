short_bio: "**Nate Heiges** (b. 1981, Shakopee, MN, USA) is an artist, curator,
  and co-founder of the gallery International Objects. Since 2021, he hosts _The
  Selection Committee,_ a music-interview radio show broadcast live on Newtown
  Radio and available on Spotify. Themes of language, mores, manners, and the
  enmeshment of the body in the physical world are central to his work, and he
  is fascinated by the insinuation of the religious impulse into science and
  secular culture. His curatorial practice has focused on the relationships
  between artistic production, the formation of sensibilities, and domestic
  spaces. Heiges received his MFA from Yale University."
