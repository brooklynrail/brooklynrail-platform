short_bio: "**Jia-Jen Lin** (b. Taichung, Taiwan) is a Taiwanese-American artist
  based in Brooklyn and Berlin. Linâ€™s practice explores human experiences and
  how they inhabit our bodies despite different space and time. With an
  interdisciplinary approach, her installations often span several media,
  including sculpture, photography, video, sound, text, and performance. By
  employing her body and mind as an experiential interface, Lins looks into the
  subjects of cultural identities, struggles, correlated relationships between
  our physicality and psychology, and the resemblance between art making and
  manufacturing in social content."
