short_bio: "**Su Yu Hsin** is an artist and filmmaker based in Berlin. She
  approaches ecology from the point of view of its close relationship with
  technology. Her artistic practice is strongly research-oriented and involves
  fieldwork where she investigates the political ecologies of water. Her work
  reflects on technology and the critical infrastructure in which the human and
  non-human converge. Her video installations are exhibited worldwide in museums
  and International Art Biennials: the Centre Pompidou-Metz, the Museum of
  Contemporary Art Busan, Taipei Biennial 2020 and 2023, ZKM Karlsruhe, and Haus
  der Kulturen der Welt, among others. Her films have been screened at Kurzfilm
  Festival Hamburg, Experimental Film and Video Festival in Seoul and e-flux."
