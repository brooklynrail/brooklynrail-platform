short_bio: "**An-My Lê** was born in Saigon, Vietnam, in 1960. Lê fled Vietnam
  with her family as a teenager in 1975, the final year of the war, eventually
  settling in the United States as a political refugee. Her photographs and
  films examine the impact, consequences, and representation of war. Whether in
  color or black-and-white, her pictures frame a tension between the natural
  landscape and its violent transformation into battlefields. She has received
  many awards, including fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial
  Foundation (1997) and the New York Foundation for the Arts (1996). She has had
  major exhibitions at San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, MoMA, and elsewhere.
  Lê lives and works in New York. "
