short_bio: "a principal of Ballman Khapalova, an architecture practice based in
  Ithaca and New York City.  Through this practice Peter works at a variety of
  scales, from infrastructure to urban playgrounds, always seeking to integrate
  intuitive and imaginative design methods with a rigorous approach to drawing,
  building and planning.  He has worked as a designer at Barkow Leibinger in
  Berlin, as well as Senior Project Manager at Sciame Construction in NYC,
  working closely on the coordination and construction of the The Shed at Hudson
  Yards.  His primary interests are in integrating the study of culture with
  building techniques and typologies across the history of architecture, and
  with the development of an intuitive design methodology drawing on a multitude
  of disciplines and techniques.  "
