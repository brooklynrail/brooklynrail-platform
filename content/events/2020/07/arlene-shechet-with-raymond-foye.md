    event_bio: Arlene Shechet employs an experimental approach to ceramic sculpture
      by testing the limits of gravity, color, and texture and pushing the
      boundary of classic techniques, sometimes fusing her kiln-fired creations
      with complex plinths formed of wood, steel, and concrete. By incorporating
      casts of firebricks and porcelain slip molds into her sculptures, she
      reflects on and investigates the tradition of decorative arts. Variously
      sensual, humorous, and elegant, her clay-based vessels evoke the tension
      between control and chaos, beauty and ugliness, perfection and
      imperfection. Shechet focuses on ensuring that the display, sight lines,
      and relationships of the objects in her exhibitions change with every view
      while maintaining formal equilibrium.
