short_bio: "Artist **Chloe Chiasson**'s practice explores themes of
  self-expression and queer identity. Figures inhabit environments reminiscent
  of her childhood in Texas that not only include but also celebrate queer
  identity within its distinct cultural context. By juxtaposing images from
  different periods and finding unexpected resonances within these disparate
  moments, she challenges us to consider a rewritten narrative. Chiasson
  received her BS from the University of Texas at Austin and MFA from the New
  York Academy of Art. While at the NYAA, she concentrated in painting and was
  awarded the Belle Artes Residency and the Chubb Post-Graduate Fellowship. In
  2023, Chiasson was awarded the prestigious Fountainhead Residency. Chiasson
  has shown internationally in London, Germany, and Hong Kong. "
