#### Monday, December 28
📽 ***King of Sanwi*** (Akosua Adoma Owusu, 2020, 7 mins) The spiritual sequel to her previous film \_Pelourinho, They Don't Really Care About Us\_ (2019) finds Akosua Adoma Owusu deftly, absorbingly synthesizing direct animation and archival footage from the Jackson 5’s 1974 visit to Dakar and Michael's 1992 crowning as an Ivorian king to meditate on the pop icon's relationship to Africa.
#### Tuesday, December 29
📽 ***Field Resistance*** (Emily Drummer, 2019, 16 mins) Something like a science-fiction documentary, Emily J. Drummer's \_Field Resistance\_ uses the subject of eco-devastation in Iowa as a springboard to conjure the eternal antagonism between humanity and nature and the increasingly blurry line between our fraught, fragile present and the prophesied dystopia to come.
#### Wednesday, December 30
📽 ***The Isolated*** (Jay Giampietro, 2020, 15 mins) Jay Giampietro's latest ranks among the best artworks to tackle Life in the Time of Covid-19 to date, with the filmmaker exercising his singular eye for street-level surreality as he takes in a locked-down NYC while meeting periodically with a friend, a lonely eccentric anxiously yearning for human connection.
#### Thursday, December 31
📽 ***Point and Line to Plane*** (Sofia Bohdanowicz, 2020, 17 mins) Sofia Bohdanowicz continues her rich, ongoing collaboration with the actor/filmmaker Deragh Campbell in this alluring narrative work, following a young woman from museum in a foreign city to museum in a foreign city as she recalls a friend by way of the paintings of Wassily Kandinsky and Hilma af Klint.
#### Friday, January 1
📽 ***Drills*** (Sarah Friedland, 2020, 17 mins) The link between performance and the everyday anxieties of our age is a prevalent subject in the work of Sarah Friedland, and her latest, \_Drills\_, is no exception, a mesmerizing dance film that locates its choreography within the physical movements of preparatory exercises (including active shooter drills and corporate meditation guides).
