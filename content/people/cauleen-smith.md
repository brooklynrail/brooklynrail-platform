short_bio: "**Cauleen Smith** is a filmmaker and artist. With a BA in cinema
  from San Francisco State University (1991) and an MFA in filmmaking from the
  University of California-Los Angeles (1998), her interdisciplinary work
  expands from histories and practices of experimental film, including
  structuralism, Third World cinema, and science fiction. Through immersive
  installations, moving-image works, sculpted objects, and textiles, she engages
  with non-Western cosmologies, Afro-diasporic histories, Black cultural icons,
  real and speculative utopias, and, in her words, “the everyday possibilities
  of the imagination.” In addition to many group exhibitions, she has had solo
  exhibitions at MASS MoCA and LA’s Museum of Contemporary Art, among others. "
