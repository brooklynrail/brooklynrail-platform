short_bio: A painter, sculptor, and poet whose work explores the practice of
  mark- and image-making as fundamental, evolutionary human functions, **Peter
  Nadin** (b. 1954 in Bromborough) is the son of a sea captain whose family
  roots stretch back centuries in northwest England. In 1980 in New York, he
  became a founder of an unlikely artists’ collective called The Offices of
  Fend, Fitzgibbon, Holzer, Nadin, Prince & Winters. In 2022, Off Paradise
  hosted the exhibitions “A Proposal to Peter Nadin, 1979; realized 2022” and
  “The Distance from a Lemon to Murder.” Nadin's work has been included in
  numerous exhibitions, and public and private collections, including The
  Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art, the Yale Center for
  British Art and the Centre Pompidou.
