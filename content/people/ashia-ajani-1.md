short_bio: "**Ashia Ajani** is a sunshower, a glass bead, a carnivorous plant,
  an overripe nectarine hailing from Denver, CO, Queen City of the Plains and
  the unceded territory of the Cheyenne, Ute, and Arapahoe peoples. Ajani is a
  lecturer in the AfAm Department at UC Berkeley and a climate resilient schools
  educator with Mycelium Youth Network. A BSF Award recipient, Ajani has
  received fellowships from Just Buffalo Literary Center, Tin House, The
  Watering Hole, UC Berkeley’s P4P Climate Activism Residency and the Milkweed
  Hub Chrysalis Institute. Ajani is co-poetry editor of the Hopper Literary
  Magazine. Ajani’s writing is a kaleidoscope of their work as an eco-griot and
  abolitionist. Their debut poetry collection, _Heirloom_, is forthcoming April
  2023 with Write Bloody Publishing."
