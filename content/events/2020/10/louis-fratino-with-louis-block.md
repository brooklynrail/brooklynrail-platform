      Louis Fratino makes paintings and drawings from specific memory and art
      historical references. He synthesizes visual languages sampled from
      antiquity to modernism to describe the contemporary body, landscape, and
      interior spaces. Fratino’s work explores the queerness in the gestures of
      everyday life.


      Born in 1993, in Annapolis, MD, Louis Fratino received his BFA in Painting with concentration in Illustration from the Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore, MD in 2015. He is a recipient of a Fulbright Research Fellowship in Painting, Berlin (2015-16) and a Yale Norfolk Painting Fellowship, Norfolk, CT in 2014. Fratino lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. The artist's first institutional solo exhibition, curated by Jared Ledesma, will open at the Des Moines Art Center in November 2021.
