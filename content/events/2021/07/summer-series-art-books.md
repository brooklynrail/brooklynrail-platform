This summer, we are celebrating the sections of the *Brooklyn Rail* with conversations, performances, and readings curated by our editors. This 2-week YouTube video series offers a view behind the scenes with the editors, artists, and writers that make the publication.

On Wednesday, July 21, Art Books editor Megan N. Liberty is joined by the Director of Center for Book Arts Corina Reynolds for a conversation on the book as art, looking at books reviewed in the *Rail* and in the collection of Center for Book Arts.
