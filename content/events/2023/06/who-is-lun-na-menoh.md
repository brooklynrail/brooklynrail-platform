D﻿irector's Note:\
Lun\*na Menoh produces her own fashion shows that are about fashion shows, where she not only designs all the clothing but also stage-manages, directs, and performs her own live music that pokes fun commentary about the nature of the high fashion show culture. My approach to this documentary is framing her life's work within the largest fashion show she's ever produced. During the course of 24 hours, I show the lead-up to the show, the rehearsals, the show itself, and after the show. Between that timeline, I intercut flashbacks of previous shows, interviews, and work Lun\*na has done throughout her decades-long career. This will complement the events that happen during the present show. The cumulative effect should reveal the highly conceptual, witty, and creative world of Lun*na Menoh.
