short_bio: "Since the mid-1980s, Tishan Hsuâ€™s prescient artistic practice has
  been probing the cognitive as well as physical affects of transformative
  technological advances on our lives. Through the use of unusual materials,
  software tools, and innovative fabrication techniques, his enigmatic paintings
  and sculptures explore and manifest poetic new ways to engage and reimagine
  the interface between an organic body and technology.   Since the late-1980s
  and 90s, Hsu has been making the majority of his paintings on canvas using a
  silkscreen process to fuse images from scanned pastel drawings of organic skin
  with appropriated biomedical images, and other parts of human, animal and
  technological bodies. "
