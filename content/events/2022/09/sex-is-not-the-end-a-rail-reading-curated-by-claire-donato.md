*From Claire Donato*: In the spirit of coupling, two memoirists, two poet-novelists, and two psychoanalysts will participate in this NSFW, early October reading. They write across a range of sexual affects: abased, attached, addicted, abstaining, healing. As individuals, they couple these affects with themes of shyness, radical reading groups, queer transformation, and falling in love with one's cat. How does one know where one ends within the structure of the couple? How does one know where one’s genre ends? We will answer these questions over a 1:00pm Zoom for *The Brooklyn Rail* :)
