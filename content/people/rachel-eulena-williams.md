short_bio: An artist working at the boundaries between painting and sculpture.
  Her reconfigured canvases unbind painting from the stretcher, avoiding
  conventional support systems and imagining a myriad of spatial contortions.
  Her evident interest in color represents a liberation from, and criticality
  of, Western art history’s othering of color, and categorizing it as unruly,
  foreign, and vulgar. Instead, her interest in imagining unrestrained
  structures exceeds those boundaries and is partially inspired by science
  fiction. Williams’ drawings also manipulate the way images are presented,
  playing with assumptions about virtuosity through abstraction.
