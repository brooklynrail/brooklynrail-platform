short_bio: Born in Palo Alto California in 1980, Hugo McCloud is one of the most
  prolific young artists working today. Self-taught with a background in
  industrial design, McCloud’s practice is unrestricted by classical, academic
  tenets. Drawing inspiration from the rawness and decay of the urban landscape,
  McCloud creates rich, large-scale abstract paintings and sculptural objects by
  fusing unconventional industrial materials — tar, bitumen, aluminum sheeting
  and oxidized steel plates — with traditional pigment and woodblock printing
  techniques. His approach is instinctive and physical, often working on the
  floor, sanding, hammering and torching his materials until a total
  metamorphosis takes place. Hugo McCloud lives and works in Brooklyn, New York
  and Tulum, Mexico.
