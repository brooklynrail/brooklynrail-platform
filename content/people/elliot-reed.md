short_bio: "**Elliot Reed** is an artist working in performance, sculpture, and
  video. Their art starts from the body, making a choreographic language through
  objects, installation, and sound. Using an intra-media approach, Elliot’s
  projects aim to capture the idiosyncrasies of live performance through
  physical means. Reed is the founder, director, and sole employee of Elliot
  Reed Laboratories, a production office located inside the artist’s body, which
  holds a copyright with The Library of Congress and a Los Angeles County
  business license. Reed has performed and exhibited internationally, including,
  at the Studio Museum Harlem, MoMA PS1, OCD Chinatown, and the Hammer Museum,
  among several others. His text manifesto “Performance Art Is…” was printed in
  _The Drama Review_, published by MIT Press. "
