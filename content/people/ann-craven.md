first_name: Ann
last_name: Craven
short_bio: (b. 1967, Boston, MA) known for her lush, serial portraits of the
  moon, birds, and flowers, as well as her painted bands of color. Craven’s
  predilection for the copy—both from referent photographs and from her own
  plein air paintings—is both an homage to Pop Art and an exploration of
  remembrance. Craven presented her first retrospective, titled TIME and curated
  by Yann Chevalier, at Le Confort Moderne in Poitiers, France in 2014. Recent
  solo exhibitions include Shane Campbell Gallery, Chicago (2019); Karma, New
  York (2018); Sothard Reid, London (2017); Maccarone, New York (2016); among
  others. Her paintings are in the public collections of the MoMA, Whitney
  Museum of American Art, New Museum, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in
  Chicago, among others.
