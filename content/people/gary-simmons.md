short_bio: "**Gary Simmonsâ€™** multidisciplinary practice continually sheds light
  on the structural racism and social stereotyping that pervades the American
  narrative. For over three decades his drawings, paintings and installations
  have blended identity, memory, poetics and rage to address the racial
  constructions created by our everyday institutions. His work is site-specific,
  with large scale projects inspired by film and media, music, and the visual
  circuitry that is hardwired within cultural memory. Currently on view at MCA
  Chicago, _Gary Simmons: Public Enemy,_ is the first comprehensive career
  survey of his work, including over 70 pieces that address race, class, and
  gender identify. Simmons also has a solo exhibition, _This Must Be The Place,_
  at Hauser & Wirth London through July 29th."
