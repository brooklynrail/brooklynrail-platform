  over the past 50 years. His solo exhibitions include the Metropolitan Museum
  of Art, Art Institute of Chicago, and Jeu de Paume. In 2017, the Museum of
  Modern Art opened a full career retrospective. His series of exhibitions at
  Light Gallery in NY in the early 1970s sparked new interest in color
  photography and in the use of the view camera for documentary work. With more
  than 30 books published, Stephen Shoreâ€™s work has had a pivotal influence on
  the language and practice of the medium. Shore currently serves as director of
  the Photography Program at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, NY, where he is
