short_bio: "**Rachel Eulena Williams** has developed a unique visual language
  operating on the threshold of painting and sculpture. A powerful duality runs
  throughout Williams’ practice. It can be seen in the use of conventional
  materials to create works that both challenge and transcend genres; in the
  interplay between two and three dimensions; in the contradiction between
  frugality and opulence (humble materials versus luminous colour); and the
  tension between optimism and sorrow. Williams’ working methods also relate to
  practices centered around community and sustainability, Rachel Eulena Williams
  (b. 1991, Miami, Florida, USA) lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. She
  holds a BFA from Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, also in
  New York."
