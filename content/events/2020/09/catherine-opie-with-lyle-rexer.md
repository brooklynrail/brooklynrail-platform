    event_bio: Catherine Opie (b. 1961, Sandusky, OH; lives in Los Angeles) is known
      for her powerfully dynamic photography that examines the ideals and norms
      surrounding the culturally constructed American dream and American
      identity. She first gained recognition in the 1990s for her series of
      studio portraits titled Being and Having, in which she photographed gay,
      lesbian, and transgender individuals drawn from her circle of friends and
      artists. Opie has traveled extensively across the country exploring the
      diversity of America’s communities and landscapes, documenting
      quintessential American subjects— high school football players and the
      2008 presidential inauguration—while also continuing to display America’s
      subcultures through formal portraits. Using dramatic staging, Opie
      presents cross-dressers, same-sex couples, and tattooed, scarred, and
      pierced bodies in intimate photographs that evoke traditional Renaissance
      portraiture—images of power and respect. In her portraits and landscapes,
      Opie establishes a level of ambiguity—of identity and place—by
      exaggerating masculine or feminine characteristics, or by exaggerating the
      distance of the shot, cropping, or blurring her landscapes.
