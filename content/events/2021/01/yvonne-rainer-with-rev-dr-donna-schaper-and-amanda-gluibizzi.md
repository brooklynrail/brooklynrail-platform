    event_bio: "Dancer, choreographer, filmmaker, and writer Yvonne Rainer
      (American, b. 1934) is one of the most influential artistic figures of the
      last 50 years. Her work has been foundational across multiple disciplines
      and movements: dance, cinema, feminism, minimalism, conceptual art, and
      postmodernism. Rainer first came to prominence as a leading figure in the
      Judson Dance Theater movement, a loose collection of dancers and artists
      whose performances (often held at the Judson Memorial Church in New York
      City) crossed fluidly between the fields of dance and visual art, creating
      a striking and intellectualized form of performance that denied the
      theatricality and emotionalism of modern dance in favor of movements that
      seemed casual, spare, and cool. Over time, Rainer's works became
      increasingly personal and political, and by the early 1970s she had begun
      to focus on producing experimental feature films. Over the next 25 years,
      Rainer produced an extraordinary series of films that engaged with the
      most advanced theoretical thinking of the time while also grappling with
      issues of power, privilege, and inequality. In 2000, Rainer returned to
      choreography and has continued to produce provocative and surprising new
      works to the present day."
