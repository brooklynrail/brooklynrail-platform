      Kate Fowle is the director of MoMA PS1. She was appointed in 2019 after
      six years as the inaugural chief curator of the Garage Museum of
      Contemporary Art, Moscow, Russia, and director-at-large at Independent
      Curators International, New York. During her tenure at Garage, she oversaw
      the institution’s transition from art center to internationally
      recognized, public-facing museum, establishing new infrastructure and
      developing departments of exhibitions, archives, education, public
      programs, performance, publishing, research, development, and
      communications. Ms. Fowle also worked closely with Rem Koolhaas and OMA to
      oversee the design and opening of Garage’s first 56,000-square-foot Museum
      building in 2015.


      Ms. Fowle’s curatorial projects at Garage included exhibitions and commissions with David Adjaye, John Baldessari, Sammy Baloji, Louise Bourgeois, Marcel Broodthaers, Olga Chernysheva, Urs Fischer, Rashid Johnson, Irina Korina, Robert Longo, Andrei Monastyrsky, Anri Sala, Taryn Simon, Juergen Teller, and Rirkrit Tiravanija, among others. In 2014 she established Field Research, the first research-oriented program in Russia for artists, and in 2017 she established Garage Triennial of Russian Contemporary Art.

      has worked at Christie’s, Harry N. Abrams Publishing, the Robert Miller
      Gallery, and for James Wolfensohn, among others. Her passion for the arts
      derives from her belief that art and culture provide vital means of
      communication across cultural and political divides. Helen is an advisor
