Warren Neidich's text based neon sculpture *The Statisticon Neon* will be the subject of a conversation between Thyrza Goodeve, Sanford Kwinter, and Barry Schwabsky. The Statisticon was a term Neidich invented in 2015 to describe a new form of power resulting from the entanglement of mental labor, Big Data and the brain’s neural plasticity. This event will begin with a short blind-folded performance of the sculpture by Neidich followed by ten minute comments by each respondent. Subjects ranging from the political power of art, poetry and architecture, neural plasticity, ecology, psychedelic drugs, the Internet of Everything and Big Data will be discussed in the hope of creating a language of resistance to our current neural-digital predicament.
