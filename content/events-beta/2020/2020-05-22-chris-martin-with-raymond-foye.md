**Chris Martin** is a contemporary American abstract painter. His wide range of material and imagery is drawn from Buddhist mandalas, the landscapes of the Catskills, and the legacy of Abstract Expressionism. Martin’s works attempt to deal with the psychological internalizations of spirituality and memory, using formalism in a way similar to both Alfred Jensen and Thomas Nozkowski. The artist regularly incorporates unconventional materials into his work, such as textiles, glitter, and vinyl records, as evidenced in Sweet Dreams (2nd Pillow Painting) (2009), a canvas where six affixed pillows are covered in bight neon paint. Born in 1954 in Washington, D.C., he studied at the School of Visual Arts in New York and Yale University. He is the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including a 2002 Guggenheim fellowship, 1999 Pollock-Krasner Foundation Award, and two National Endowment for Arts fellowships. The artist lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. Martin’s works are in the collections of the Albright Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, among others.
