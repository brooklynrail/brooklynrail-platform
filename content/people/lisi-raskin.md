short_bio: Lisi Raskinâ€™s creative and curricular practices are laboratories for
  building bridges between politicized subject matter, queer ontologies, utopian
  architecture, abstraction, collaborative making, non-hierarchical
  interventions into normative systems of power, and engaged pedagogy. These
  laboratories support the making of paintings, drawings, objects, videos,
  animations, and large, constructed environments that house pedagogical,
  performative, and socially engaged programming. Raskin is a member of the rock
  band Peebls. With this group, Raskin loved, laughed, learned, cooked, and ate
  while co-authoring a demo album of intersectional propaganda for children of
  all ages. Raskin is working on a book about engaged and inclusive pedagogy.
  They are the Department Head of Sculpture at RISD.
