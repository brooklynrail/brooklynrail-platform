**Andrea Marina** is a queer indigenous poet originally from Miami, FL. Her work mainly centers around heartbreak, violence, and the swamps of her homeland. She currently lives in Oakland, CA.

**Kamelya Omayma Youssef** is a poet-writer-teacher from Lebanon by way of Dearborn, Michigan. She is currently an MFA candidate in Poetry at New York University, and she is working on a few poetry manuscripts, a longer critical hybrid text, as well as a play. Her poems have been published in the *Michigan Quarterly Review*, *Cordite Poetry Review*, *Mizna*, *Agape*, *Birdâ€™s Thumb* and on the theater stage with A Host of People. She also develops and presents creative workshops with her friends. Her ongoing project is mastering the art of being in multiple places at once, as in obliterating borders (as in those of nation-states and genres, for now).

*The Poetry Project is committed to making our event programming inclusive and accessible for individuals with different experiences, and are continuously working to improve and expand upon accessibility measures. Our online broadcasts feature live transcription and are presented on broadcasts compatible with most screen readers. If you have a question about either of these resources, or an accessibility measure we haven't described, please contact us at rm@poetryproject.org.*

\*This event will take place virtually and be transcribed live by Otter.
