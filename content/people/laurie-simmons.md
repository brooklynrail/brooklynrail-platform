short_bio: "Since the mid-1970s, artist **Laurie Simmons** has staged scenes to
  create images with intensely psychological subtexts and nonlinear narratives.
  By the 1980s Simmons was at the forefront of a generation of artists,
  predominantly women, whose use of photography began a new dialogue in
  contemporary art. Her work is included in many permanent collections
  worldwide. The Modern in Fort Worth and The Museum of Contemporary Art in
  Chicago presented a major retrospective of Simmonsâ€™s work, titled _Big
  Camera/Little Camera,_ in 2018-19. Simmons lives and works in New York and
  Connecticut. "
