short_bio: New York based Uruguayan writer and researcher whose work develops a
  relational, historically-grounded perspective at the intersection of art and
  politics, and culture and the environment. Current projects examine urban
  dwellersâ€™ access to nature in New York City public spaces; the interactions of
  artists and archivists with near-obsolete technologies in marginal spaces of
  cultural production and reproduction; and New Yorkers' experiences with the
  pandemic, through the NYC COVID-19 Oral History, Narrative, and Memory
  Archive, which she co-directs. She directs the stand-alone MA Program in
  Sociology at Columbia University and edits Dispatches from the Field, a series
  dedicated to publishing collections of ethnographic data.
