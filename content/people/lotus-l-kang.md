short_bio: "**Lotus L. Kang** works with sculpture, photography and
  site-responsive installation. Known for her sprawling installations and
  distinctive material repertoire, Kangâ€™s practice is a dialogue with the
  impermanent and the in between. Elegantly disordered and richly layered, her
  site-sensitive works explore the relational bonds between time, personal
  history, and cultural knowledge. She seeks to disrupt a human-centred
  perspective of the world with a broad curiosity for life and matter tangled in
  states of exchange that produce and are reproduced by their environments.
  Selected exhibitions include: _In Cascades,_ Chisenhale Gallery, London
  (2023);  _Fleshing Out The Ghost,_ Deborah Schamoni, Munich (2023);  and
  _Mesoderm,_ Franz Kaka, Toronto (2023), among many others. "
