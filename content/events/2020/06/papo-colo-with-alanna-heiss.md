**Papo Colo** (b. 1946, Puerta de Tierra, Puerto Rico) is a performance artist, painter, writer, and curator who lives and works in New York City and the El Yunque rainforest in Puerto Rico. 

In 1982 he co-founded Exit Art with Jeanette Ingberman, which became one of New York’s most important alternate art spaces. Colo’s work has been exhibited at numerous venues, most recently as part of the exhibition Radical Presence, organized at the Contemporary Art Museum, Houston, and which traveled to the Walker Art Center, the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, and the Studio Museum in Harlem (2013-2015). His work has also been shown at The Clocktower (2013), Galeria de la Raza, San Francisco and MoMA PS1, New York (both 2009), El Museo del Barrio (2008), National Gallery of Puerto Rico (2007), Grey Art Gallery (2006), Art in General (2006), RISD Museum, Providence (2005), and the Bass Museum of Art, Miami Beach (2001).

**Alanna Heiss**, Director of Clocktower Productions, is a leader of the groundbreaking early 1970’s alternative spaces movement in New York City, which radically changed the way large-scale art projects were produced, shown, and seen. In 1972 she founded the legendary Clocktower Gallery, and in 1976 she founded P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center (now MoMA PS1) which she directed for 32 years and transformed into an internationally renowned non-collecting center for the production and presentation of contemporary art.

The talk will conclude with a poetry reading by Papo Colo.
