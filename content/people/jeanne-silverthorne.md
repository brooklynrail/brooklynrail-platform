short_bio: "**Jeanne Silverthorne** is a sculptor who lives and works in New
  York. Her process is almost invariably one of modeling in clay, making a mold
  and then casting in platinum silicone rubber. Her practice involves an
  archaeology of collapse and entropy. Since the early 1990’s, she has been
  excavating the conceptual and physical ruins of the studio whose outmoded
  infrastructure and lost artifacts, art forms, actions and people produce a
  contemporary vanitas. Unearthing what has been buried in the rubble, bringing
  the concealed to light suggests “deep storage” and many works address what is
  invisible or packed away. Since 2007 she has been making a functional rubber
  crate for every sculpture."
