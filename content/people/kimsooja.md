name: Kimsooja
first_name: Kimsooja
short_bio: "**Kimsooja** is an international conceptual artist whose practice
  transcends distinctions of medium and form through works of painting, sewing,
  installation, performance, video, light, sound, and architecture. The
  evolution of her artistic inquiry from the material to the immaterial
  parallels Kimsooja’s principle of “non-doing” and “non-making”that draws
  awareness to what already exists without the intent of making it. Her
  reflection on a myriad of sociopolitical issues and existential borders, from
  migration and displacement to identity, poverty, religious clashes, and life
  and death find their origin in the question of the surface in painting.
  Kimsooja’s work has been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions, biennials
  and triennials, and large-scale site-specific projects."
