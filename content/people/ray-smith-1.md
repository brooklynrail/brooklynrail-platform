short_bio: "**Ray Smith** (American, b.1959) Born in Brownsville, TX, and raised
  in Central Mexico. Smith emerged in the 1980s and continues to produce
  exuberant paintings and sculptures characterized by an inimitable style and
  subject matter that reflect his bi-cultural American and Mexican heritage.
  Contorted and morphed figures recur throughout his work, in a hybrid that
  draws from his early studies of fresco painting with traditional practitioners
  in Mexico, and an indebtedness to Picasso, the Surrealists, and the
  politically daring Mexican muralists. Through these varied beings, Smith
  reflects upon the complexities and absurdities of society, family, politics,
  culture, war, and the human condition itself, framed by birth and death."
