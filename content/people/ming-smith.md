short_bio: "**Ming Smith's** practice is a tale of five decades spent examining
  transitory occurrence—intervals at which figures blur, atmospheres alter,
  vistas haunt, souls whir, and opposites engage in allied work. Smith’s
  photographic approach is both scientific and celestial, and experimentation
  and adventure mark her fascination with detail as it stretches across form and
  mood. Her dedication to music, dance, and theater underlines the synergistic
  excellence that characterizes her secondary, if metaphoric, occupations as
  anthropologist, historian, and poet. Many of Smith’s subjects are well-known
  Black cultural figures, such as Alice Coltrane, Grace Jones, Nina Simone and
  Tina Turner."
