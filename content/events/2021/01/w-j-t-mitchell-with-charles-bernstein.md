      literature, Mitchell is associated with the emergent fields of visual
      culture and iconology (the study of images across the media). He is known
      especially for his work on the relations of visual and verbal
      representations in the context of social and political issues. Under his
      editorship,  Critical Inquiry has published special issues on public art,
      psychoanalysis, pluralism, feminism, the sociology of literature, canons,
      race and identity, narrative, the politics of interpretation, postcolonial
      theory, and many other topics. He has been the recipient of numerous
      awards including the Guggenheim Fellowship and the Morey Prize in art
      history given by the College Art Association of America. "

    event_bio: Charles Bernstein is a poet and a scholar. He is a foundational
      member and leading practitioner of Language poetry. Between 1978-1981,
      with fellow poet Bruce Andrews, he published L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E magazine,
      which became a forum for writing that blurred, confused, and denied the
      boundary between poetry and critical writing about poetry. Since the 1970s
      Bernstein has published dozens of books, including poetry and essay
      collections, pamphlets, translations, collaborations, and libretti. His
      poetry has been widely anthologized and translated, and it has appeared in
      over 500 magazines and periodicals. His most recent book is Near/Miss,
      from the University of Chicago Press.

How does a parent make sense of a child’s severe mental illness? How does a father meet the daily challenges of caring for his gifted but delusional son, while seeking to overcome the stigma of madness and the limits of psychiatry?  W. J. T. Mitchell’s memoir tells the story—at once  representative and unique—of one family’s encounter with mental illness and bears witness to the life of the talented young man who was his son.

*Mental Traveler: A Father, A Son, and a Journey through Schizophrenia* is available The University of Chicago Press here:<https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo49299282.html>
