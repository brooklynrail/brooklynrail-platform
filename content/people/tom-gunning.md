short_bio: 'Professor Emeritus of Art History, Cinema and Media Studies at
  University of Chicago **Tom Gunning** works on problems of film style and
  interpretation, film history and film culture. His published work
  (approximately one hundred publications) has concentrated on early cinema
  (from its origins to the WW I) as well as on the culture of modernity from
  which cinema arose (relating it to still photography, stage melodrama, magic
  lantern shows, as well as wider cultural concerns such as the tracking of
  criminals, the World Expositions, and Spiritualism). His concept of the
  \"cinema of attractions\" has tried to relate the development of cinema to other
  forces than storytelling, such as new experiences of space and time in
  modernity, and an emerging modern visual culture. '
