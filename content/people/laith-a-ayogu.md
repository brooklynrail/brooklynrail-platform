short_bio: "**Laith A. Ayogu** (b. Jos, Nigeria) is a New York based
  anti-disciplinary, performance artist, educator and writer. Arising from their
  studies of multimodal ethnography at Bard College, their work reckons with
  fraught fantasies of home, displacement and diaspora across the Black
  Atlantic. They are currently racked with the questions of whether the syllabus
  is a site and what force or imposition could sunder the subaltern? Their
  practice seeks out verse, movement and paroxysm to confront the confines of
  colonial (in)sanity and intelligibility. Their academic work has been
  published on Anthrodendum, in U Chicago’s Resources for improvised
  ethnographic tactics, and at Whitney Museum’s Stonewall 50th Anniversary.
  Their poetry can be found in Queer.Archive.Work's Urgency Reader."
