short_bio: moved to New York from Florida in 1959, by 1962 he was part of the
  nascent Judson Dance Theatre, gaining early recognition for his performances,
  while simultaneously working as a visual artist. In the 1960s, he made
  paintings, drawings, and sculpture based on everyday objects, meticulously
  rendered and surprisingly out of scale. Hay followed an increasingly
  conceptual path in his work, embracing circumstance by responding to and
  recording his whereabouts or activities, making use of a tool or material at
  hand, or employing something as unpredictable as the weather.  His work
  reflects his state of perpetual observation and acute presence.  Hayâ€™s latest
  paintings, monumentally-scaled details of the coats of four of his cats, are
  his first portraits, or representations of life.
