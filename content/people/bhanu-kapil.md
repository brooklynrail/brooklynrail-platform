short_bio: "is a poet. In 2020, she won a Windham Campbell Prize for Poetry, and
  a Cholmondeley Award, also for poetry. In 2021, her most recent book, How To
  Wash A Heart (Liverpool University Press) won the T.S. Eliot Prize.  2021 also
  brings a new edition of Incubation: a Space for Monsters from Kelsey Street
  Press, with new essays on performance and shame, and a preface by Eunsong
  Kim.  After twenty years at Naropa University, where she taught across genres
  and disciplines, Bhanu is now a part of Churchill College, Cambridge, where
  she has recently been appointed an Extraordinary Fellow.  This bio represents
  a complete change in the circumstances of Bhanu Kapil: a return to her
  birthplace (England), and a chance to keep working in the near-ground of
  colonial time."
