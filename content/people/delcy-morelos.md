short_bio: "Born in 1967 in Tierralta in the region of Córdoba in Colombia,
  **Delcy Morelos** studied at the Cartagena School of Fine Arts. She lives and
  works in Bogotá. Her practice is rooted in ancestral Andean cosmovision and
  the aesthetics of Minimal Art. Morelos’ abstract works, with their formidable
  evocations, inspire rumination on the interplay between human beings and
  earth, the human body and materiality. Morelos's recent material
  investigations have extended into ceramics textiles, and natural materials,
  leading to the development of a more sculptural practice, and, more recently,
  large-scale multisensory installations. Past solo exhibitions have been held
  at Museo Moderno, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fundación NC-Arte, Bogotá, Röda
  Sten Konsthall, Göteborg, Sweden, and elsewhere. "
