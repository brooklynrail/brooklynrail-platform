short_bio: Throughout a career spanning four decades, **Lubaina Himid** (born
  1954, Zanzibar; lives and works in Preston, UK) has explored and expanded the
  possibilities of painting and storytelling to depict contemporary everyday
  life and to fill gaps in art history through the centering of Black figures
  and experiences. A self-described “painter and a cultural activist,” Himid
  rose to prominence in the 1980s as a pioneer of the British Black Arts
  Movement and a staunch advocate for the contributions of women of color to the
  visual arts. She is the recipient of both the 2023 Maria Lassnig Prize and the
  2024 Suzanne Deal Booth / FLAG Art Foundation Prize, among others, and her
  first exhibition at Greene Naftali will open this May.
