last_name: Waldman
short_bio: "Internationally recognized and acclaimed poet Anne Waldman has been
  an active member of the “Outrider” experimental poetry community, a culture
  she has helped create and nurture for over four decades as writer, editor,
  teacher, performer, magpie scholar, infra-structure curator, and
  cultural/political activist. Her poetry is recognized in the lineage of
  Whitman and Ginsberg, and in the Beat, New York School, and Black Mountain
  trajectories of the New American Poetry. But has raised the bar as a feminist,
  activist, and powerful performer. She remains a highly original “open field
  investigator” of consciousness, committed to the possibilities of radical
  shifts of language and states of mind to create new modal structures and
  montages of attention. "
