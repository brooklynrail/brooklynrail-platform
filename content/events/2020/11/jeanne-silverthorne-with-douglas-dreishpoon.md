      Jeanne Silverthorne is an acclaimed and influential New York-based artist
      whose works take their cue from the human body, as well as domestic and
      industrial items including lighting fixtures and bulbs, junction boxes,
      and various packing materials. For decades, she has thought of her studio
      as a generative site where acts of thinking, making, destroying, and
      accepting take place. 


      Her practice involves an archaeology of collapse and entropy. Since the early 1990’s, she has been excavating the conceptual and physical ruins of the studio whose outmoded infrastructure and lost artifacts, art forms, actions and people produce a contemporary vanitas. Unearthing what has been buried in the rubble, bringing the concealed to light suggests “deep storage” and many works address what is invisible or packed away. Since 2007 she has been making a functional rubber crate for every sculpture.
