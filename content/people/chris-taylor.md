short_bio: "**Chris Taylor** is an architect, educator, and director of Land
  Arts of the American West at Texas Tech University. His research interests
  investigate land art, landscape, embodied fieldwork, and making-based design.
  In 2001, he began developing Land Arts as a semester abroad program in our own
  backyard to investigate the intersection of human construction and the
  evolving shape of the planet. His books, Land Arts of the American West and
  Incubo Atacama Lab, chronicle the evolution of this field researchâ€”operating
  across the arid lands of the Americas. He has lectured extensively at
  institutions including Yale University, Parsons The New School, Tyler School
  of Art in Philadelphia, and elsewhere. "
