    event_bio: Andrei Codrescu was born in Transylvania, Romania, reborn at the age
      of 19 in Detroit and New York in 1967-1970. A professional nomad he has
      lived in San Francisco, Monte Rio California on the Russian River,
      Baltimore, Baton Rouge and New Orleans. He is the recipient of 40,000
      angry letters from Ralph Reed’s “silent majority” for urging
      Christian  believers in the “Rapture” to ascend to Heaven  as quickly as
      the Lord will make room for them. He did this on NPR, which as we know, is
      the radio station all evangelicals listen to – religiously. Codrescu’s
      first book of poetry was “License to Carry a Gun” in 1970, and his most
      recent, “The Art of Forgetting” (2019) He writes novels and essays and won
      the Peabody award for the film “Road Scholar.”

  - person: ann-waldman
    event_bio: "Internationally recognized and acclaimed poet Anne Waldman has been
      an active member of the “Outrider” experimental poetry community, a
      culture she has helped create and nurture for over four decades as writer,
      editor, teacher, performer, magpie scholar, infra-structure curator, and
      cultural/political activist. Her poetry is recognized in the lineage of
      Whitman and Ginsberg, and in the Beat, New York School, and Black Mountain
      trajectories of the New American Poetry. But has raised the bar as a
      feminist, activist, and powerful performer. She remains a highly original
      “open field investigator” of consciousness, committed to the possibilities
      of radical shifts of language and states of mind to create new modal
      structures and montages of attention. "
