short_bio: "**Chakaia Booker** is a New York-based artist. She is best known for
  her pioneering use of recycled rubber tires as a raw material for making
  abstract sculpture, often at a monumental scale. Booker merges ecological
  concerns with explorations of racial and economic difference, globalization,
  and gender. The artistâ€™s works are contained in more than 40 public
  collections and have been exhibited across the US, in Europe and Asia. Booker
  was included in the 2000 Whitney Biennial and received a Guggenheim Fellowship
  in 2005. Her current show at David Nolan Gallery, Public Opinion, is open
  through June 23."
