short_bio: "**Chang Tan** is an Associate Professor of Art History and Asian
  Studies at Penn State University, specializing in Chinese, East Asian, and
  Asian diasporic art of the 20th and 21st century. Her upcoming book _The
  Minjian Avant-garde: Contemporary Chinese Artists in Search of the
  Public_  (Cornell, 2023) studies how experimental artists mixed with, brought
  changes to, and let themselves be transformed by minjian, the volatile and
  diverse public of the post-Mao era, and critically assesses the rise of
  populism in both art and politics. Dr. Tan has published in peer-reviewed
  journals such as  _Art Journal, Diacritics, World Art, and Third Text_. Her
  curatorial and editorial activities explore the connections between Asian and
  Asian American art. "
