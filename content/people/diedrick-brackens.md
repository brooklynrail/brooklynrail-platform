short_bio: "**Diedrick Brackens** explores the intersections of identity and
  sociopolitical issues by creating handwoven tapestries that reexamine allegory
  and narrative through material, autobiography, and the broader themes of
  African American and queer identity, American history and memory. Brackens’
  recent solo shows include his first European show at Kestner Gesellschaft,
  Hannover, Germany, as well as shows at the Mint Museum, Charlotte, NC, Craft
  Contemporary, Los Angeles, CA, Blanton Museum of Art, Austin, TX, Oakville
  Galleries, Ontario, Canada, and the New Museum, New York, NY. He is the
  recipient of the US Artist Fellowship, 2021, Louis Tiffany Comfort Grant,
  2019, Marciano Artadia Award, 2019, and the Studio Museum in Harlem’s Joyce
  Alexander Wein Artist Prize, 2018."
