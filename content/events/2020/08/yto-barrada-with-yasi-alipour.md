      Yto Barrada’s installations reinterpret social relationships, uncover
      subaltern histories, and reveal the prevalence of fiction in
      institutionalized narratives. Barrada arrived at her artist practice
      through studies of history and political science, particularly in the
      negotiation of political and personal experiences. Much of Barrada’s work
      has since focused on borderlands, microhistories, and autonomous agency
      within a political landscape. Interested in developing a platform for
      cross-cultural dialogue and exchange, She founded the non-profit
      Cinémathèque de Tanger in 2006. Tangier’s first and only repertory cinema
      and archive, the Cinémathèque operates out of a restored 1930s theatre
      known as the Cinema Rif, located in one of the city’s main squares.
       
      Informed by postcolonial thought and socio-political concerns, Barrada’s interests range from the tensions around borders, immigration, and tourism to the urban landscape, and from children’s toys to botany and paleontology. Her practice encompasses photography, film, sculpture, painting, printmaking, and publishing, while her installations are often comprised of both original work and found objects.Nonverbal communication, family myths, “hidden transcripts” that unearth new grammars—within the interlinked logic of Barrada’s work lie secrets, pleasures and a celebration of strategies of resistance to domination.
