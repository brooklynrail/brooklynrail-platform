short_bio: "**Ken Weathersby** is a contemporary visual artist known for his
  innovative approach to abstract painting. Born in Mississippi, he received his
  MFA from Cranbrook Academy of Art. Weathersbyâ€™s works are characterized by
  their intricate structures and the incorporation of unconventional materials.
  His art often features canvases with elements removed or rearranged, creating
  a unique interplay of depth and surface, and allowing a collision of images,
  texts, and real space with abstraction. Weathersby has had solo exhibitions at
  Minus Space and Pierogi Gallery in New York, and in various galleries and
  institutions across the United States earning notable awards and fellowships."
