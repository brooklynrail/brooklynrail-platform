short_bio: Sacramento-born artist **Liz Larner** experiments with abstract
  sculptural forms in an array of materials, including polychromatic ceramics
  that evoke the tectonic geologic shifts of the western landscape. An inventor
  of new forms, Larnerâ€™s sculptures defy easy description by design. Larner's
  30-year retrospective _Don't Put It Back Like It Was_ was on view at the
  Sculpture Center in New York and The Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in 2022.
  Her work has been included in group and solo exhibitions internationally, and
  is in numerous public and private collections. Larner has also been the
  recipient of numerous awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Nancy
  Graves Foundation Grant.
