      Kate Fowle is the director of MoMA PS1. She was appointed in 2019 after
      six years as the inaugural chief curator of the Garage Museum of
      Contemporary Art, Moscow, Russia, and director-at-large at Independent
      Curators International, New York. During her tenure at Garage, she oversaw
      the institution’s transition from art center to internationally
      recognized, public-facing museum, establishing new infrastructure and
      developing departments of exhibitions, archives, education, public
      programs, performance, publishing, research, development, and
      communications. Ms. Fowle also worked closely with Rem Koolhaas and OMA to
      oversee the design and opening of Garage’s first 56,000-square-foot Museum
      building in 2015.


      Ms. Fowle’s recent writing includes catalogue texts on Rasheed Araeen, Ilya and Emilia Kabakov, Ari Marcopoulos, Sterling Ruby, Althea Thauberger, and Qiu Zhijie. She has authored three books—Proof: Francisco Goya, Sergei Eisenstein, Robert Longo (2016); Exhibit Russia: The New International Decade 1986–1996 (2016); and Rashid Johnson: Within Our Gates (2016).


      From 2009 to 2013, Ms. Fowle was the executive director of Independent Curators International (ICI). Previously, Ms. Fowle was the inaugural international curator at the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing from 2007 to 2008 and chair of the Master’s Program in Curatorial Practice at California College of the Arts in San Francisco, which she cofounded in 2002. Before moving to the United States, Ms. Fowle was codirector of Smith + Fowle in London.
