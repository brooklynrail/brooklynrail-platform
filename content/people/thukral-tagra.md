short_bio: Collaborate artist duo **Jiten Thukral** and **Sumir Tagra** work
  with a wide range of media including painting, sculpture, installations,
  interactive games, video, performance, and design. Thukral & Tagra work on new
  formats of public engagement and attempt to expand the scope of what art can
  do, further emphasizing what the practice can do in a virtual context through
  their archives and publications. They break out of the mediated-disciplinary
  world, create multi-modal sensory, and storytelling in immersive environments.
  Recently, they seek to identify the practice as pedagogy through their
  collaborative Pollinator.io â€“ Interdisciplinary lab, which cultivates an
  inclusive learning ecosystem that indexes to achieve knowledge sharing through
  cross-pollination.
