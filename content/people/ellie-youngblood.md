short_bio: Sky High Farm Vegetable Production Manager **Ellie Youngblood** grew
  up in nearby Kent, CT and fell in love with farming at the age of 16 after
  spending a summer working at a local vegetable operation. For seven years,
  Ellie managed Fairfield Farm at Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, CT where she
  had the opportunity to introduce (or re-introduce) high school students to
  farming and the power of land-based connections. Time and time again, she
  witnesses farms as places of community, nourishment, and abundance, and is
  continuing to build relationships in her role at Sky High.
