  recently the Program and Administrative Coordinator at the African Roots
  Center in Kingston, NY. Just prior, she completed a Master’s Degree in English

  small local businesses to host similar conversations, and create profitable
  opportunities for people of color, like the marketplace at Commissary! in New
  Paltz, where artists of color can sell their work to the cafe for shelving
  space at full retail price.
