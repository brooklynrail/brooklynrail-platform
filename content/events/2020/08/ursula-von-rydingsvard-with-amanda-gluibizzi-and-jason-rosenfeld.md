    event_bio: "Ursula von Rydingsvard was born 1942 in Deensen, Germany. She has
      lived and worked in New York City for over 40 years. Over a remarkable
      four-decade-long career, Ursula von Rydingsvard has become one of the most
      influential sculptors working today. She is best known for creating
      large-scale, often monumental sculpture from cedar beams, which she
      painstakingly cuts, assembles, and laminates before finally rubbing a
      graphite patina into the work’s textured, faceted surfaces. Her signature
      abstract shapes refer to things in the real world — vessels, bowls, tools,
      and other objects — each revealing the mark of the human hand while also
      summoning natural forms and forces. In recent years, von Rydingsvard has
      explored other mediums in depth, such as bronze, paper, and resin,
      continuing to expand upon her unique artistic vocabulary. "
