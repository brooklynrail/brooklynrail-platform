This summer, we are celebrating the sections of the *Brooklyn Rail* with conversations, performances, and readings curated by our editors. This 2-week YouTube video series offers a view behind the scenes with the editors, artists, and writers that make the publication. 

On Monday, July 19, Field Notes editor Paul Mattick is joined by writer and communist geographer Phil Neel for a conversation on the nature of capitalist crisis in China and beyond, as well as the role of the nation-state in the continual reproduction of capitalism as a global social system pushing the human species to the brink of extinction.
