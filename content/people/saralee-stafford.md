  poems shared today are taken from _Letters in the Capsid_— an upcoming full
  length book of prose-poetry to be published by Hi-Lo Press (@Hilopress /
  Atlanta). Born from the bedside of COVID nursing, _Letters in the
  Capsid_ chronicles a dance between life and death and life and work in a
  crisis. Her poetry has mostly been self or community published and found in
  person. Her past life as a writer of southern insurrectionary history can be
  found by AK Press (Chico, CA)."
