short_bio: The work of artist **Andrew Yong Hoon Lee** encompasses sound, the
  moving image, drawing and sculpture and examines sensory perceptions through
  the use of language, experience and space. His practice explores themes that
  range from the relationship between sounds and meaning in language, the
  phenomenologies of the diasporic and how memory and migration perform new
  imaginaries. Materially, Lee uses the lexicon of sound as it relates to other
  fields of knowledge. Lee has presented works at the Center For Performance
  Research (NY), The International Symposium On Electronic Arts (Vancouver), The
  Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, Achtung Cinema (Paris), among several other
  venues.
