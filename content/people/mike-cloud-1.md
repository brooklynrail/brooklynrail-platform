short_bio: "**Mike Cloud** is a painter who experiments with materials and
  techniques embedded in mass-culture to both activate and defy preconceived
  notions of painterly expression. Drawing on deep human experiences such as
  death, community and freedom, combined with his countercultural relationship
  to painting, Cloud creates totalizing pictures— “holistic abstractions”. His
  works have been exhibited at Frieze London; Thomas Erben Gallery, NYC, NY; The
  Studio Museum in Harlem, NYC, NY; MoMA PS1, Long Island City, NY and the
  American Academy of Arts and Letters, NYC, NY. Cloud is an Associate Professor
  in the department of Art, Theory & Practice at Northwestern University. "
