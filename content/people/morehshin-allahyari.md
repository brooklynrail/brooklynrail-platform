short_bio: "**Morehshin Allahyari** (Persian: موره شین اللهیاری‎), is a NY based
  Iranian-Kurdish artist using 3D simulation, video, sculpture, and digital
  fabrication as tools to re-figure myth and history. Through archival practices
  and storytelling, her work weaves together complex counternarratives in
  opposition to the lasting influence of Western technological colonialism in
  the context of SWANA (Southwest Asia and North Africa). Her work has been part
  of numerous exhibitions, festivals, and workshops at venues throughout the
  world, including the MoMa, Centre Pompidou, and Venice Biennale di
  Architecture, and many others. She is the recipient of The United States
  Artist Fellowship (2021) and The Joan Mitchell Foundation Painters & Sculptors
  Grant (2019), among other recognitions. "
