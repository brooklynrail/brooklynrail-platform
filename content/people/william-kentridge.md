short_bio: Often drawing from socio-political conditions in post-apartheid South
  Africa, **William Kentridge**â€™s work takes on a form that is expressionist in
  nature. Kentridge was born in 1955 in Johannesburg, South Africa where he
  currently lives and works. His process of recording history is constructed
  from reconfigured fragments to arrive at a provisional understanding of the
  past. His work spans a diverse range of artistic media such as drawing,
  performance, film, printmaking, sculpture and painting. Kentridge has also
  directed a number of acclaimed operas and theatrical productions.
