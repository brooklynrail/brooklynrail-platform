short_bio: Born in Cambodia in the aftermath of the Khmer Rouge, **Vandy
  Rattana** grew up in Phnom Penh and began his photography practice in 2005.
  His first works straddled the line between photojournalism and artistic
  practice. His recent works mark a shift in philosophy surrounding the
  relationship between historiography and image making. Since _Bomb Ponds_
  (2009), Rattana has been scanning the idyllic Cambodian countryside with his
  viewfinders and revealing its traumatic past. His short films _MONOLOGUE_
  (2015), _Funeral_ (2018), and _â€¦far away, over there, the ocean_ (2019) form
  the _MONOLOGUE_ trilogy. Rattana contributed to the creation of art spaces in
  Cambodia from 2007 to 2012, and now lives in Taiwan. His photography and video
  works are exhibited and shown worldwide.
