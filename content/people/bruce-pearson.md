short_bio: "**Bruce Pearson** makes distinctive and hypnotic works that push the
  limits of painting. Constructed on Styrofoam panels, his paintings are fields
  of sensuous color and intricately creviced surfaces, with visceral impact and
  optical effects. His seamlessly constructed, intricately layered images are
  unique investigations in which text is the basis of image and image
  reverberates with meaning. Pearson has been exhibiting professionally for over
  15 years, and his work is in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American
  Art and the Museum of Modern Art, New York. He was awarded a Skowhegan
  Residency in 2001 and has lectured and critiqued at many institutions,
  including the School of Visual Arts and Parsons School of Design. He currently
  lives and works in New York."
