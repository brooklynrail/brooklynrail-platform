last_name: Rojas
short_bio: A multidisciplinary artist working primarily with the body in
  performance, using video, photography, installation, public interventions and
  sculpture. As a queer latinx immigrant with indigenous heritage, he engages in
  the postcolonial ethical imperative to uncover, investigate, and make known
  undervalued or disparaged sites of knowledge, narratives, and individuals. He
  utilizes his body as an instrument to unearth removed traumas, embodied forms
  of decolonization, migration and poetics of space. His research based practice
  is influenced by queer and feminist archives, border politics, botanical
  colonialism, and defaced monuments. He is also a translator, community
  activist, yoga teacher, and anti-oppression facilitator with queer, migrant,
  and refugee youth.
