name: evil dentist
first_name: evil dentist
short_bio: "**evil dentist** was created by Alice Gerlach and David Farrow as a
  response to the decline in do-it-yourself venues accelerated by the pandemic.
  evil dentist seeks to reclaim space for unconventional, artist-run venues
  prioritizing community building over commerce. Emerging from a series of
  performances in a haphazardly built East Village loft, evil dentist centers on
  the notion that performance and place-making are intertwined, politicized acts
  of care. Curatorially operating at the fringes of experimental, pop, and rave
  music, evil dentist programs eclectic performances that challenge artists to
  rethink how they connect to their audience."
