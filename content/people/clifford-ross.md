short_bio: "**Clifford Ross** began his career as a painter and sculptor, and in
  1994 became deeply involved with photography and other media. His singular
  goal has been to create work that relates to the sublime in nature. Using both
  realistic and abstract means to achieve his goals, he often develops radically
  new approaches to existing media. His photographic techniques expanded over
  time, using digital methods, inkjet printing, and ultimately developing his
  unique method of printing on wood. Rossâ€™ works have been exhibited in museums
  around the world, and are in many collections including the Museum of Modern
  Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the
  Parrish Art Museum, the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts,
  Houston."
