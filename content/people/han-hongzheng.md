short_bio: "**Han Hongzheng** (they/them) received their MA from the Institute
  of Fine Arts, NYU in 2019. During their study at the IFA, Han co-found IFA
  Contemporary Asia, the first pan-Asian art forum at NYU. Han is now an
  independent curator and art researcher working and living in NYC. Focusing on
  racial identities and body politics, Hanâ€™s curatorial works include _Runaway
  World 2020: Ten Chinese Artists Group Show_; _Beyond Borders: Art in the Post
  COVID Era_, and others. Han is determined to utilize their personal and
  educational exploration of racial identity and queerness to develop
  methodologies that bring exposure to under-represented artists and
  marginalized groups, as well as establish a sophisticated rejection of an
  outdated east/west academic dichotomy."
