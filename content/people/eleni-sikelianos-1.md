short_bio: Born in California on Walt Whitmanâ€™s birthday, **Eleni Sikelianos**
  is a poet, writer, and \"a master of mixing genres.\" She grew up in earshot of
  the ocean, in small coastal towns near Santa Barbara, and has since lived in
  San Francisco, New York, Paris, Athens (Greece), Boulder (Colorado), and
  Providence. Deeply engaged with ecopoetics, her work takes up urgent concerns
  of environmental precarity and ancestral lineages. _Your Kingdom_ (Winter
  2023) will be her tenth book of poetry, riding alongside two
  memoir-verse-image-novels.
