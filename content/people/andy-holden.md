short_bio: "**Andy Holden's** work comprises large installations, sculpture,
  painting, music, performance, animation, curating and multi-screen-videos. The
  artist is known for his intensely personal, eclectic work, often involving
  cartoon representations of himself and an oscillation between irony and
  sincerity. From 2011-2017 Holden worked on _Laws of Motion in a Cartoon
  Landscape,_ a hour-long animated film exploring the idea that the world was
  now best understood as a cartoon. The sequel, _Structure of Feeling,_ attempts
  to describe the world to come. Comprising a series of cartoon animations,
  sculptures and paintings, it forms the core of Holden’s current exhibition at
  Charles Moffett. Holden’s work can be found in the permanent public
  collections of Tate, Bristol Museum, and many others."
