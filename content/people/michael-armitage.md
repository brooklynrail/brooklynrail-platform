short_bio: "**Michael Armitage** was born in Nairobi, Kenya and lives and works
  in London. His paintings weave multiple narratives draw from historical and
  current news media, internet gossip, and his own ongoing recollections of
  Kenya. The visual iconography of East Africa lies at the heart of his
  practice: its urban and rural landscape, colonial and modern vernacular
  architecture, advertising hoardings, lush vegetation and varied animal life.
  Undermining this rich color palette and dream-like imagery, however, is a
  quiet exposition of Kenyaâ€™s sometimes harsh reality: its politics, social
  inequalities, violence and extreme disparities in wealth. In turn, Armitage
  reflects on the absurd aspects of the everyday, commenting on both society and
  the surrounding natural environment."
