**2﻿024 Out-FRONT! Fest Schedule**

Jason Anthony Rodriguez
*Take a Good Look / Meet Me in the Moon*
Wednesday, January 10, at 8pm, and Thursday, January 11, at 7pm\
The LGBT Community Center, Theatre 301

{{< image media="2023/12/jason-rodriguez" size="lg" >}}

Vogue artist and Pose star Jason Anthony Rodriguez’s work *Take a Good Luck* takes a direct look into one’s queerness through the perspective of a Dominican, dancer, actor, Gaymer. The work looks closely at the layers that make us, build us, and rip us apart, exploring tools that allow us to regroup in a healthy manner. *Meet Me in the Moon* is a piece set by choreographer/teacher Kevin Wynn on the Joffrey Ballet School Summer Intensive in 2013. It will be reset as a solo for these performances.

Joey Kipp with Pioneers Go East Collective
*Tracing Lorraine* (World Premiere)
Thursday and Friday, January 11-12, at 8pm
The LGBT Community Center, Theatre 301

{{< image media="2023/12/joey-kipp" size="lg" >}}

Joey Kipp’s *Tracing Lorraine* is a theatrical performance and sharing of Kipp’s connection with the Black queer playwright Lorraine Hansberry and her ghost, pulling forth the common thread of personal memory and erasure. Through a trilogy of works by Hansberry, Kipp imagines her humanistic vision for a contemporary audience. Rooted in an early pandemic video work by Kipp based on Hansberry’s play *What Use Are Flowers?*, Tracing Lorraine deepens his research into the author’s life and work with the addition of two more plays, *The Drinking Gourd* and *Les Blancs*. The theme of erasure to rebuilding prevails not only in the plays’ narratives, but also in Hansberry’s and Kipp’s personal histories, separated by over 60 years, in confronting the loss of their identities within normative society and their respective creative/cultural communities.

Conceived, choreographed, and performed by Joey Kipp. Co-choreographed by Symara Johnson. Dramaturgy
by Chloe O. Davis. The project was developed in collaboration with Pioneers Go East Collective’s artists Gian
Marco Riccardo Lo Forte (creative director), Jo Wiegandt (assistant director/producer), and Philip Treviño
(production designer).

Ogemdi Ude
*Hear*
Saturday and Sunday, January 13-14, at 7pm
The LGBT Community Center, Theatre 301

{{< image media="2023/12/ogemdi-ude" size="lg" >}}

In *Hear*, choreographer Ogemdi Ude pulls from a bereft archive of video and sound bites in an attempt to materialize and present the profile of someone lost. The solo, originally a part of a trilogy, is of Ude’s ongoing practice in deriving coping rituals in the aftermath of loss. Her work is built by grieving the loss of loved ones, and preserving the language, movements, and creative actions that emerge from that grief. She opens portals to the dead to communicate with them, retell their stories, and preserve their memory. Can we connect to people who aren’t here anymore by making something out of all the bits that are? Featuring sound by slowdanger. *Hear* premiered in 2022.

Christopher Unpezverde Núñez
*YO OBSOLETE*
Sunday and Monday, January 14-15, at 8pm
The LGBT Community Center, Theatre 301

{{< image media="2023/12/christopher-unpezverde-nunez" size="lg" >}}

Childhood memories intertwined with intergenerational trauma. Escapism from reality to worlds of fantasy and symbolism. Parallels between the mystical and embodied experiences. *YO OBSOLETE* meditates on imagination as a survival mechanism. The performance navigates through altered states of consciousness, reaching deep levels of ancestral memory embodied in the form of poetry, songs, movement, installation and story telling.

Arthur Aviles and Collaborators
*Naked Vanguard*
Wednesday, January 17, and Friday, January 19, at 8pm
Abrons Arts Center Playhouse

{{< image media="2023/12/arthur-aviles" size="lg" >}}

Arthur Aviles continues his *Naked Vanguard* series, which reimagines several of his classic nude solo dance
works. In addition to revealing the body, the works peel back the conventions of Latinx and Black cultures.
The works use Aviles’s Swift/Flow dance technique and will be performed by Nikolai McKenzie Ben Rema,
Hunter Sturgis, and Aviles. The program includes *Morning Dance* (2021), *In the End, Let’s Begin* (2021),
*Untitled #5A After Ted Shawn AKA Dansé Mexicaine & Jamaïquaine Américaine* (World Premiere), and the
Bessie Award-winning *A Jamaican BattyBwoy in America* (2021).

Annie MingHao Wang
*had my mouth* (World Premiere)
Thursday, January 18, at 8pm and Saturday, January 20, at 5pm
Abrons Arts Center Playhouse

{{< image media="2023/12/annie-minghao-wang" size="lg" >}}

Constantly shifting between renewing dualities of being and place, *had my mouth* is a performance that asks:
How do we use dance to speak and to build protected spaces? Derived from choreographer Annie MingHao
Wang’s personal and physical inquiries into the human invocations of animal energies within Chinese culture,
the work pulls specific inspiration from the lion dance and martial arts. Beyond their role as entertainment,
these movement forms were historically practiced as covert training in self-defense as protection against
oppressive governmental systems. had my mouth furthers this stance by referencing the diverse influences of
martial arts in the US to convey the timeless search for protection through self-expression. Performed by
Catherine Chen, Ching-I Chang, and Annie MingHao Wang. Music by Eldar Baruch.

Paz Tanjuaquio / TOPAZ ARTS Dance Productions
*Silweta* (World Premiere)
Friday, January 19, at 7pm, and Saturday, January 20, at 6pm
Abrons Arts Center Playhouse

{{< image media="2023/12/paz-tanjuaquio" size="lg" >}}

TOPAZ ARTS Dance Productions will premiere an evening-length dance, *Silweta*, choreographed and
performed by Paz Tanjuaquio with a trio of guest performers, and created in collaboration with sound and
visual artist Todd B. Richmond. With *Silweta*, based on silhouette images of traditional dance forms of the
Philippines, Tanjuaquio traces a distant dance in her ongoing process of creating new movement. Behind the
silhouettes, Tanjuaquio explores cultural connections, migration, and displacement. Inspired by various texts,
including *Dead Stars*, a short story by her namesake Paz Márquez-Benítez, in which the idea that light from
dead stars still shine can be a metaphor for lives lost and a presence of culture that resonates within our
bodies. Silweta brings to light edges of a distant dance, tracing the outer limits of our connected lives. The
work includes Petroglyph by Indigenous composer Brent Michael Davids, a digital dance of silhouettes made
with Onome Ekeh will also be incorporated within the performance.

**F﻿ilm Screenings**

Saturday, January 13, 5pm-6:30pm
The LGBT Community Center, Gallery 101

Interdisciplinary artist Fana Fraser will present a new short film, originally commissioned by TBA21-Academy
(Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary) for TBA21 on st_age.\
\
A new film by Omega X & Danni. Omega and Danni are trans and nonbinary artists and parents of two kids.
As queer parents, their vision is to create visibility and possibility for people who look like them. This new
work is an abstract portrait film exploring the experience of queer parenthood.

*The Personal Things* (2016) is an animated film by writer, filmmaker, and activist Tourmaline, whose practice
highlights the experiences of Black, queer, and trans communities and their capacity to impact the world.
Tourmaline writes, “You have to find your own way to strike back. Black trans elder and legendary activist
Miss Major Griffin-Gracy describes how everyday personal acts fuel her political activism.”
