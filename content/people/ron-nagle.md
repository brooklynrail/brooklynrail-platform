short_bio: Artist **Ron Nagle** was born in San Francisco, where he currently
  lives and works. His first one-person exhibition took place in 1968, and since
  then he has had exhibitions at numerous museums, including the Carnegie Museum
  of Art in Pittsburgh, the San Diego Museum of Art, the Museum Boijmans Van
  Beuningen in Rotterdam, the Secession in Vienna,  the Fridericianum in Kassel,
  and the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive. Nagle is known for his
  intimately scaled sculptures made of ceramic elements that are slip-cast,
  fired, and embellished with epoxy and other synthetic materials that allow him
  to expand his forms beyond the limits of clay. Some are glazed to a hot-rod
  finish, others textured like stucco and then airbrushed.
