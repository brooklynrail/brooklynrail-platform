short_bio: "**Nicole Peyrafitte's** work – in the form of paintings, drawings,
  films, texts, photography – cultivates “sympoiesis” (making-with). The series
  Karstic-Actions (2011- ), explores proprioception and kinesthesia as meeting
  points between (action) painting, poetry, text, voice, photography, film,
  health, improvised music, and, at times, cooking. Peyrafitte has shared food
  with audiences since the 90s in a search for sustainability of body & mind,
  with health as central axis. Recent works include _Antediluvian Sympoiesis_ —
  Sapar Contemporary Gallery, NYC (2022); _Karstic Actions/ Works with Pierre
  Joris_ — Gallery Simoncini, Luxembourg (2021); _11 Women of Spirit,_ Salon
  Zürcher, NYC (2020). Publications include _Connection en Millefeuille_
  (RedfoxPress 2022) and _Landsc0pes_ (2018)."
