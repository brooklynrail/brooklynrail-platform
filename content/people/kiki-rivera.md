short_bio: "Award-winning theater artist, educator, and arts activist, **Kiki
  Rivera** (she, we, they) holds a BA in Theater and an MFA in Playwriting from
  the University of Hawaii at Mānoa. Original plays include *Puzzy*,
  anthologized in *Samoan Queer Lives*, *Faʻalavelave: The Interruption*, and
  *Lighting the Way: An Anthology of Short Plays About The Climate Crises*. As
  an educated gender-queer Samoan-Filipinx born in raised in Hawaii, Rivera
  acknowledges their privilege and responsibilities to marginalized communities:
  their work focuses on cultural and sexual identity within a context of
  post-colonization as is one among many voices for Pacific Islanders in
  diaspora. “I believe in the value of self-reflective storytelling from a
  contemporary Indigenous perspective.”"
