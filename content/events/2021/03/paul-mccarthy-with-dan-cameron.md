    event_bio: "Widely considered to be one of the most influential and
      groundbreaking contemporary American artists. Born in 1945, and raised in
      Salt Lake City, Utah, he first established a multi-faceted artistic
      practice, which sought to break the limitations of painting by using
      unorthodox materials such as bodily fluids and food. He has since become
      known for visceral, often hauntingly humorous work in a variety of mediums
      – from performance, photography, film and video, to sculpture, drawing and
      painting. He earned a BFA in painting from the San Francisco Art Institute
      in 1969, and an MFA in multimedia, film and art from USC in 1973. For 18
      years, McCarthy taught performance, video, installation, and art history
      in the New Genres Department at UCLA, where he influenced future
      generations of west coast artists and he has exhibited extensively
      worldwide. "

    event_bio: "A New York-based curator, art writer, and educator whose
      professional career began with his 1982 New Museum of Contemporary Art
      exhibition, Extended Sensibilities: Homosexual Presence in Contemporary
      Art, the first museum effort in the US to examine gay & lesbian identity
      in art. During his eleven years as Senior Curator at the New Museum
      (1995-2006), Cameron organized survey exhibitions of David Wojnarowicz,
      Martin Wong, Marcel Odenbach, and Pierre et Gilles, among many others.
      While serving as artistic director of international biennials from
      Istanbul and Taipei to Newport Beach, CA and Cuenca, Ecuador, Dan is
      probably best-known as the founding director of Prospect New Orleans,
      organized to assist in the cultural rebuilding of the city after Hurricane
      Katrina; and in 2016 he organized the exhibition When Jackie Met Ethyl on
      Jackie Curtis and Ethyl Eichelberger at Howl! Happening on NYCs Lower East
