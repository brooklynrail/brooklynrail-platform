short_bio: "Curator **Risa Puleo** researches the entanglement between the
  Americas and Europe during the early modern period with a focus on how
  Indigenous American objects and people were important to the formation of the
  Wunderkammer and Early Modern Museum through their collection as objects of
  wonder, scrutiny, spectacle, and study. Her exhibition _Walls Turned Sideways:
  Artists Confront the American Justice System_ at Contemporary Arts Museum in
  Houston (2018-19) was founded on her research into the museum and prison as
  sister institutions developing from the same cultural logic. Puleo is a
  student in the Art History doctoral program at Northwestern University,
  Chicago. She has written for _Art in America_, _Art Papers_, _Asia Art
  Pacific_, _Modern Painters_, among other publications."
