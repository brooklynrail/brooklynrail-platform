short_bio: "**Fred Eversley** (b. 1941) is a pivotal figure in West Coast
  postwar contemporary art. Influenced by Southern California movements like
  Light and Space, his work is a unique synthesis, shaped by lifelong studies of
  light, space, time, gravity. A former engineer, Eversley collaborated with
  NASA, contributing to Gemini and Apollo programs. This developed his interest
  in the parabola, which emerged in his youth. Eversley's pioneering use of
  materials like plastic and polyester resin mirrors postwar technological
  leaps, while unveiling the enduring mysteries of human perception - art
  transcending eras, offering timeless insights into the workings of the human
  eye and mind."
