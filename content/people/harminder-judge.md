short_bio: "**Harminder Judge** lives and works in London. His practice explores
  processes of spiritual and material transformation while drawing from a
  diverse array of sources for inspiration, including a funeral pyre on his
  family’s farm in rural Punjab, India, and the rebuilding of a 1930’s bungalow
  in South Yorkshire, England. With references to the Abstract Expressionist and
  color field movements of the 20th century as well as traditions of Neo-Tantric
  painting, Judge’s works negotiate the boundaries of color, form, and
  composition to create transportive portals that bridge the physical and
  metaphysical. His intensive process involves layering pigments into pools of
  wet plaster followed by prolonged periods of excavation in the form of
  sanding, oiling, and polishing."
