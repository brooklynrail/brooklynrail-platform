short_bio: "**Jessica Ke’mani** (pronounced Keh-Mani) is an Oakland-born poet.
  Ke’mani is the author of the new poetry chapbook, _Power of Our Wombs_
  (Nomadic Press, February 2023). Recently, Ke’mani appeared on Susan Ruth’s
  _Hey Human_ podcast where a wonderful conversation took place on adoption,
  reunification, and her book. Ke’mani also appeared on _Adoptees-on_ podcast
  with Haley Radke, which will debut sometime this fall. Although they are no
  longer pursuing social work in the academic world, supporting children and
  families in the Placement system is deeply gratifying work. Ke’mani has spent
  the last few years studying Creative Writing at Northeastern University at
  Mills College in Oakland and has found purpose and challenge in English
  tutoring and hopes to pursue more work in this area."
