short_bio: "**Dineo Seshee Bopape** lives and works in Johannesburg, South
  Africa. She was a co-winner of the Artes Mundi 9 prize in 2021, the recipient
  of a 2010 Columbia University Toby Fund Award, and the winner of 2008 MTN New
  Contemporaries Award. Bopape is known for her use of soil and other organic
  material as a base for multisensory, multidimensional work that connects
  deeply with the earth. In addition to her packed earth installations, the
  artist also works with drawing, video, and sound to create a rich practice
  connecting to memory, belonging, and place. Bopapeâ€™s works have been shown in
  numerous solo exhibitions around the world, most recently at MoMA, New York
  (2023) and Pirelli HangarBicocca, Milan."
