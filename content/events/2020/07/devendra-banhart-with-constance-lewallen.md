    event_bio: Born in Texas, and raised by his mother in Venezuela until returning
      to California as a teenager, Devendra Banhart is admired for his
      shimmering, folk-inflected psychedelia. In a near two-decade career,
      Banhart has worked with Yoko Ono, Beck, and Caetano Veloso.  The
      self-described “very bad Buddhist,” and keen skateboarder, is also a
      visual artist and poet. His debut poetry collection, Weeping Gang Bliss
      Void Yab-Yum, was published in April 2019, and, like his songs, reflects a
      quirky, whimsical, at times melancholic sensibility. His most recent album
      is Ma, a collection of tender and elegant songs that speak to the Buddhist
      belief that everyone has been a mother at some point.
