Over the past 21 years the _[Brooklyn Rail](https://brooklynrail.org/)_ has undertaken a miraculous journey, bringing together in a single monthly publication art, music, dance, film, theater, and literature, along with thoughtful social and political meditations. 

In addition to publishing one of New York’s last free newspapers, the Rail reached 3 million readers online in 2021, and hosted 260 lunchtime New Social Environment conversations, permanently available in our archive. This expansion has meant that we have been able to elevate the voices and contributions of many more people than ever before.

As a small non-profit, we need your support. Please consider making a donation today. Your contribution will directly support writers, guest artists, and production staff in this unique time.
