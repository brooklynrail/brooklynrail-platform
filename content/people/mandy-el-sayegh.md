short_bio: "**Mandy El-Sayegh**’s highly process-driven practice is rooted in an
  exploration of material and language. Executed in a wide range of media,
  including densely layered paintings, sculpture, installation, diagrams, and
  sound and video, El-Sayegh’s work investigates the formation and break-down of
  systems of order, be they bodily, linguistic, or political. Through simple,
  repetitive patterns such as a hand-painted grid or geometric molds, formal and
  narrative synthesis occurs that is not consciously intended or anticipated.
  Solo and two-person exhibitions of El-Sayegh’s work have been organized at
  Lehmann Maupin, Seoul, South Korea (2022), UTA Artist Space, Los Angeles, CA
  (2022), and elsewhere, and is held in many private and public collections. "
