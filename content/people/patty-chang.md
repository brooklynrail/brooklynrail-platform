short_bio: Los Angeles based artist and educator **Patty Chang** uses
  performance, video, installation and narrative forms when considering
  identity, gender, transnationalism, colonial legacies, the environment,
  large-scale infrastructural projects and impacted subjectivities. Her
  exhibition and book _The Wandering Lake_ investigates the landscapes impacted
  by large scale human-engineered water projects such as the Soviet mission to
  irrigate the waters from the Aral Sea, as well as the longest aqueduct in the
  world, the North to South Water Diversion Project in China. Her most recent
  multichannel video project _Milk Debt_ combines the act of lactation with
  peopleâ€™s unspoken fears. Chang teaches at the University of Southern
  California in Los Angeles, CA.
