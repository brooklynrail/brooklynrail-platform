GEGO, Gertrud Louise Goldschmidt (b. 1912 in Hamburg, d. 1994 in Caracas) was one of the leading artists of her generation in Latin America, known above all for her large-scale spatial installations. She regarded her works not as sculptures, but as structures or drawings in space. 

Gego was of Jewish origin and had to emigrate to Venezuela in 1939, at the age of 27. In Caracas, she began working as an artist and also as a university teacher. Her delicate, rhizomatically structured objects made of metal and wire challenged the traditional definition of sculpture as an enclosed mass and volume. Her groundbreaking and experimental approach to sculpture and 'drawing in space' had a significant influence on subsequent generations of artists in Latin America, leaving its mark on contemporary art far beyond Venezuela. 

Nathalie David combines present day footage from Caracas and archive footage of Gego’s work and life with Gego’s texts, “Sabiduras and Testimonies”, and statements from curators, art historians and family members.
