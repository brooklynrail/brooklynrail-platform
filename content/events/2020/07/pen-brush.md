      ways of seeing that transcend and interrogate gender, sexual, and racial
      norms. Flash works primarily in portraiture with a 4x5 film camera,
      engaging those who are often deemed invisible. In 2008, she was a resident
      at Lightwork. Most recently, Flash was awarded an Art Matters grant, which
      allowed her to further two projects, in Brazil and London. Flash has work
      included in important public collections such as the Victoria and Albert
      Museum in London.  Her work is featured in the publication Posing Beauty,
      edited by Deb Willis, currently on exhibit across the US, and she is in
