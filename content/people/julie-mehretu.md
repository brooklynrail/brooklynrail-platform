short_bio: (b. 1970, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia) lives and works in New York City. In
  exploring palimpsests of history, from geological time to a modern day
  phenomenology of the social, Julie Mehretu's works engage us in a dynamic
  visual articulation of contemporary experience, a depiction of social behavior
  and the psychogeography of space. Mehretu’s work is informed by a multitude of
  sources including politics, literature and music. Most recently her paintings
  have incorporated photographic images from broadcast media which depict
  conflict, injustice, and social unrest. Mehretu’s practice in painting,
  drawing and printmaking equally assert the role of art to provoke thought and
  reflection, and express the contemporary condition of the individual and
  society.
