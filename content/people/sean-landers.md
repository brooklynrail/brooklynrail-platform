short_bio: "**Sean Landers** is an American conceptual artist, best known for
  using his personal experience as public subject matter and for utilizing
  diverse styles and media in a performative manner. Through the use of
  painting, sculpture, photography, drawing, writing, video and audio, Landers
  reveals the process of artistic creation through humor and confession, gravity
  and pathos. He blurs the lines between fact and fiction, reality and fantasy,
  sincerity and insincerity, while presenting a portrait of the artist’s
  consciousness. Landers’s work is represented in numerous museum and public
  collections including the Brooklyn Museum of Art; Los Angeles County Museum of
  Art; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; and elsewhere. Landers lives and works in
  New York City."
