short_bio: "**Suzanne Jackson** (b. 1944, St. Louis) lives and works between
  Savannah, Georgia, and St. Remy, New York. For nearly five decades, the artist
  has worked experimentally across mediums, including drawing, painting, poetry,
  dance, theater, and costume design. In the early 1970s, Jackson worked as an
  artist and teacher in Los Angeles, where she engaged a community of artist
  peers and established Gallery 32, showcasing figures like David Hammons, Senga
  Nengudi, and Betye Saar. During this time, Jackson was known for her
  figurative paintings using layers of watercolor-like acrylic wash to depict
  the melding of humans and nature. Jacksonâ€™s recent works are composed of pure
  acrylic and found materials."
