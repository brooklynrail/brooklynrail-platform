short_bio: "**Danielle McKinney** (b. 1981, Montgomery, Alabama) creates
  narrative paintings that often focus on the solitary female protagonist.
  Engaging with themes of spirituality and self, her paintings uncover hidden
  narratives and conjure dreamlike spaces, often within the interior domestic
  sphere. McKinney's work is in private and public collections including the
  Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden; Dallas Museum of Art; and the Institute
  of Contemporary Art, Miami, FL, among others. Her work has been included in
  the exhibitions _Heroic Bodies_ at the Rudolph Tegners Museum, Dronningmølle,
  Denmark, _IN A DREAM YOU SAW A WAY TO SURVIVE AND YOU WERE FULL OF JOY_ at The
  Contemporary Austin, and _Black Melancholia_ at Hessel Museum of Art, among
  others. "
