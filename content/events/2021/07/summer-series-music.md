This summer, we are celebrating the sections of the *Brooklyn Rail* with conversations, performances, and readings curated by our editors. This 2-week YouTube video series offers a view behind the scenes with the editors, artists, and writers that make the publication.

On Friday, July 23, Music editor George Grella is joined by saxophonist and composer Darius Jones, Executive and Artistic Director of TIME:SPANS festival Thomas Fichte, and Founder of the Vision Festival Patricia Nicholson Parker for a conversation on the return of live music.
