short_bio: "**Ali Banisadr**’s densely populated paintings are influenced by the
  artist’s perception of sound as inextricably linked to color and form. Drawing
  on childhood experiences of the Iran-Iraq war in his native Tehran (where
  explosions and other aural disturbances were commonplace) as well as his
  extant synesthesia, Banisadr works painstakingly and intuitively to build
  complex compositions that exude a vitality at once turbulent and celebratory.
  Banisadr has been the subject of solo exhibitions at Academy of Fine Arts,
  Vienna and elsewhere. He lives and works in New York City. "
