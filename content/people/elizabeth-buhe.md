short_bio: "**Elizabeth Buhe** specializes in art of the twentieth and
  twenty-first centuries in Europe and America. Her work addresses how art
  mediates knowledge through its intersections with philosophy, social
  psychology, and processes of perception. At the Centre for American Art, her
  research explores the productive transfers between discourses of
  phenomenology, science, and abstract art in postwar France. Elizabeth has
  taught at the Whitney Museum of American Art and at Fordham University, and is
  a contributing critic for  _Art in America_  and the  _Brooklyn Rail_. Her
  scholarship has received support from the Henry Luce Foundation, the Getty
  Research Institute, the Fulbright Commission, the Smithsonian American Art
  Museum, and the Terra Foundation for American Art."
