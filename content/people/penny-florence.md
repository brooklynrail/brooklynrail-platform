short_bio: "**Penny Florence** is an inter/cross/un/disciplinary artist and
  writer, and a feminist materialist who struggles with “isms.” She exhibits
  digital poetry, films and mixed installations, especially with the Newlyn
  Society of Artists (NSA), performing gallery readings internationally,
  including at Tate Modern/Britain and LA MoCA. Appointments include: Head of
  Research Programmes (Slade School of Fine Art) leading practice-based art PhDs
  there and at Falmouth University; and Chair of Humanities and Design Sciences
  at Art Center, Pasadena, USA. Resisting the label “academic”, her work
  fundamentally explores how forms and processes of thinking intersect with art
  and media."
