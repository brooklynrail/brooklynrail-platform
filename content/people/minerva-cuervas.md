short_bio: Through the intervention of images and objects of daily consumption,
  **Minerva Cuevas** invites us to rethink the role corporations play in food
  production and the management of natural resources. Employing irony and humor,
  her work provokes reflection about the impact that local actions can have on
  the enforcement of fair labor practices and the redistribution of monetary
  flow. Cuevasâ€™ practice encompasses a wide range of media, including painting,
  video, sculpture, photography and installation, through which she investigates
  the politics and power structures that underlie specific social and economic
  ties. In 2004, she was recipient of the Grant for Media Art of the Foundation
  of Lower Saxony at the Edith-Russ-Haus, among other recognitions.  Cuevas
  lives and works in Mexico City.
