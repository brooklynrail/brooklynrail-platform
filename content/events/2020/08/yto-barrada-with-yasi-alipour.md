      Yto Barrada (b. 1971 works and lives in New York) is a Moroccan-French
      artist recognized for her multidisciplinary investigations into cultural
      phenomena and historical narratives. 

      Engaging with archival practices and public interventions, Barrada’s installations uncover lesser known histories, reveal the prevalence of fiction in institutionalized narratives, and celebrate everyday forms of reclaiming autonomy. 


      She is the founder of Cinémathèque de Tanger,  an arthouse cinema and a cultural center that has become a landmark institution bringing the Moroccan community together to celebrate local and international cinema.


      Barrada’s work has won numerous awards including the 2019 Roy R. Neuberger Prize, the Rotterdam Film Festival 2016 Tiger Award for short film, a nomination for the 2016 Prix Marcel Duchamp, the 2015 Abraaj Group Art Prize, the 2013 Robert Gardner Fellowship in Photography (Peabody Museum at Harvard University), and the 2011 Deutsche Guggenheim Artist of the Year award. 


      Her work is held in the collections of, and has been exhibited at, the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), Tate Modern (London), The Museum of Modern Art (New York), Guggenheim (New York), Centre Pompidou (Paris), Serralves Museum (Porto), Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig Wien, Canadian Centre for Architecture (Montreal), among others. 


      Yto Barrada is represented by Sfeir-Semler Gallery (Hamburg, Beirut), Pace gallery (New York, London) and galerie Polaris (Paris).
