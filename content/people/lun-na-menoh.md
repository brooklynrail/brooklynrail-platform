short_bio: "**Lun*na Menoh** is a Japanese-born Renaissance artist who lives in
  Los Angeles. Her work deals with garments that expose the invisible thread
  between performance and fabric by making sculpturesque dresses, paintings,
  sculptures, and a series of runway shows with her conceptual but wearable
  outfits. In early 2005, she started making music, and currently performs as
  Les Sewing Sisters, whose debut album was released in 2021. Menoh's work has
  been exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, Santa Monica
  Museum of Art, and the Hayward Gallery, London. Since the early 1990s she has
  presented work at many Los Angeles art spaces and venues, and her work is held
  in the permanent collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London."
