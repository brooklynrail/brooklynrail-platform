short_bio: Gallerist **Sean Kelly** began his career in England as an artist,
  before branching into work as a museum curator and director. After relocating
  to New York, he established his eponymous gallery in 1991. Under his
  stewardship, the gallery has become a symbol for high-quality,
  thought-provoking contemporary art and conversation. Kelly is equally
  committed to education, human rights, and social justice issues, making the
  gallery available free of charge to educational advocacy groups and school
  tours throughout the year. Recently, he and his wife, Mary Kelly, donated
  their extensive James Joyce collection to the Morgan Library and Museum. He
  currently serves on the board of PEN America, where he is co-chair of the
  annual PEN Literary Gala.
