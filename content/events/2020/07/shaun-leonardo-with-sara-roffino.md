    event_bio: Shaun Leonardo’s multidisciplinary work negotiates societal
      expectations of manhood, namely definitions surrounding black and brown
      masculinities, along with its notions of achievement, collective identity,
      and experience of failure. His performance practice, anchored by his work
      in Assembly – a diversion program for court-involved youth at the
      Brooklyn-based, non-profit Recess, is participatory and invested in a
      process of embodiment. Leonardo is a Brooklyn-based artist from Queens,
      New York City. His work has been featured at The Guggenheim Museum, the
      High Line, and New Museum, with a recent solo exhibition at Maryland
      Institute College of Art (MICA). From fall 2018 through spring 2020,
      Leonardo enacted socially engaged projects at Pratt Institute as the
      School of Art, Visiting Fellow.
