{{< endowment >}}


Our goal is to raise a $10 million endowment, which will allow us to be less burdened by financial instability and to be more generous with our print issues and our online editions, as well as the _[River Rail](https://brooklynrail.org/special/River_Rail_Colby/)_, a publication dedicated to climate change and global warming, and Rail Curatorial Projects, which aims to curate group exhibitions that respond specifically to location, cultural moment, and economic conditions. Having this $10 million endowment will allow us to support our important public programing, which includes poetry readings, film screenings, dance and music performances, panel discussions with artists, art historians, curators, scientists, writers, philosophers, and others. All of these events, as well as the print edition of the _Brooklyn Rail_, and everything else we do, are [free to the public](https://brooklynrail.org/where-to-find-us).

Please support and contribute to our endowment, which will keep the _Brooklyn Rail_ alive, free, and relevant, to ensure that what we do in the arts, humanities, and sciences is made available to everyone, not just the cultural elites. Each and every one of our creative friends is like a musician who has the unique talent of being able to achieve a unique voice on a specific instrument. Each has a particular sound, which must and should be individually treasured. And at the same time, we know that when they bring their distinct instruments together they can also create an even richer symphonic sound that is capable of nurturing our souls.

Founded in October 2000, the [Brooklyn Rail](https://brooklynrail.org/) provides an independent forum for arts, culture, and politics throughout New York City and far beyond.

Our journal features criticism of visual art, music, dance, film, theater and literature, alongside thoughtful political commentary and original fiction and poetry.

The Rail is distributed free of charge both in print and online, and further fulfills its mission by curating art exhibitions, panel discussions, reading series and film screenings that reflect the complexity and inventiveness of the city’s
artistic and cultural landscape. [Learn more »](https://brooklynrail.org/about)
