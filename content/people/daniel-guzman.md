short_bio: "**Daniel Guzmán** is a voracious reader with an incurable love for
  music, who digests, absorbs, and recombines musical and literary references.
  Residues from the artist’s daily life in Mexico City and, more recently, in
  Guadalajara—such as comics, cartoons, song lyrics, pre-Hispanic iconography,
  and press clippings—are part of his vocabulary. Ink, pencil, acrylic, and
  pastel are used to create images that appear in constant transformation,
  sometimes interlaced with texts in a complex weave of connections. His
  sculptures, videos, and installations suggest a personal and intimate
  territory that emerges from closely examining the culture and urban landscapes
  that surround him. With a strategic and contagious sense of humor, Guzmán
  reflects upon his experience of the world."
