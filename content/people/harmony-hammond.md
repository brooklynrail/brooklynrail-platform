short_bio: "**Harmony Hammond** is an artist, art writer and independent
  curator. A leading figure in the development of the feminist art movement in
  New York in the early 1970s, she was a co-founder of A.I.R., the first women’s
  cooperative art gallery in New York (1972) and Heresies: A Feminist
  Publication on Art & Politics (1976). Since 1984, Hammond has lived and worked
  in northern New Mexico, teaching at the University of Arizona, Tucson from
  1989–2006. Hammond’s earliest feminist work combined gender politics with
  post-minimal concerns of materials and process, frequently occupying a space
  between painting and sculpture – a focus that continues to this day. Hammond’s
  book, _Wrappings: Essays on Feminism, Art and the Martial Arts_ (1984), is a
  foundational publication on 1970s feminist art. "
