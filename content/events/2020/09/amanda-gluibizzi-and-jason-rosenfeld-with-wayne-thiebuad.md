    event_bio: Wayne Thiebaud was born Mesa, Arizona in 1920, and his family soon
      moved to Los Angeles in 1921. In high school he became interested in stage
      design and lighting, and worked part-time at a movie theater where he made
      posters for lobby displays, 1935-1938. During this time he also worked as
      a summer apprentice program in the animation department of Walt Disney
      Studios, 1936. From 1942 to 1945, Thiebaud served in the Air Force,
      assigned to the Special Services Department as an artist and cartoonist,
      and eventually transferred to the First Air Force Motion Picture Unit,
      commanded by Ronald Reagan. It is not difficult to detect the influence
      that this commercial experience had on his later paintings attributed to
      Pop Art; Thiebaud's characteristic work displays consumer objects such as
      pies and cakes as they are seen in drug store windows. Thiebaud uses heavy
      pigment and exaggerated colors to depict his subjects, and the
      well-defined shadows characteristic of advertisements are almost always
      included. Objects are simplified into basic units but appear varied using
      seemingly minimal means. Thiebaud had his first solo exhibition at the
      Crocker Art Gallery in Sacramento. He lectured at the Art Department of
      the Sacramento City College until 1959, when he became a professor at the
      University of California in Davis. Today, Wayne Thiebaud lives and works
      in California.
