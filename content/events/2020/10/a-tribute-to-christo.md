      Barbara Rose is an American art historian and critic who has published
      widely in the field of modern American art. Born in 1938 in Washington,
      DC, Rose studied at the Sorbonne, Smith College, Barnard, and finally,
      Columbia University under Meyer Shapiro. Rose became immersed in the New
      York-based circle of modernist artists and curators in the late 1950s and
      early 1960s, and made her substantial contribution to the discourse on
      contemporary art with the insider's perspective this afforded her.


      Rose taught at Yale University, Sarah Lawrence, University of California at Irvine and San Diego, and the American University Art in Italy program, and was senior curator at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, from 1981-1985. A prolific writer, Rose is the author of American Art Since 1900(1967), The Golden Age of Dutch Painting (1969), American Painting: The 20th Century (Skira, 1969), and monographs on the artists Magdalena Abankawicz, Helen Frankenthaler, Robert Rauschenberg, Alexander Liberman, Larry Rivers, and others, as well as dozens of exhibition catalog essays. She held editorial positions at Art in America, Vogue, Artforum, Partisan Review, and Journal of Art, and her writing has also appeared in Art International, Studio International, Arts Magazine, and ARTnews, among many others.

    event_bio: Ibrahim Mahama was born in 1987 in Tamale, Ghana. He lives and works
      in Accra, Kumasi and Tamale. Ibrahim Mahama uses the transformation of
      materials to explore themes of commodity, migration, globalisation and
      economic exchange. Often made in collaboration with others, his
      large-scale installations employ materials gathered from urban
      environments, such as remnants of wood, or jute sacks which are stitched
      together and draped over architectural structures. Mahama’s interest in
      material, process and audience first led him to focus on jute sacks that
      are synonymous with the trade markets of Ghana where he lives and works.
      Fabricated in South East Asia, the sacks are imported by the Ghana Cocoa
      Boards to transport cocoa beans and eventually end up as multi-functional
      objects, used for the transportation of food, charcoal and other
      commodities. ‘You find different points of aesthetics within the surface
      of the sacks’ fabric’, Mahama has said. ‘I am interested in how crisis and
      failure are absorbed into this material with a strong reference to global
      transaction and how capitalist structures work.’
