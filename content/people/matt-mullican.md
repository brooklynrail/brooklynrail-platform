short_bio: "**Matt Mullican** is a contemporary artist best known for combining
  performance, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, and video as a means of
  exploring the subjective through the intersection of communal signage and
  personal semiotics. A part of the “Pictures Generation” alongside Jack
  Goldstein, Cindy Sherman, Sherrie Levine, and Richard Prince, Mullican decodes
  images and signs through diagrams, patterns, and written words. The artist has
  also been known to examine his own subconscious through hypnotism in his quest
  to understand patterns and how they may be broken. Mullican’s works are in the
  collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, The Museum of Modern Art in New
  York, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, among others. Mullican lives
  and works in New York, NY."
