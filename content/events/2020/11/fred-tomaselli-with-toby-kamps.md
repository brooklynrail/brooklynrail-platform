    event_bio: "Drawing upon art historical sources and Eastern and Western
      decorative traditions, Fred Tomaselli's works explode in mesmerizing
      patterns that appear to grow organically across his compositions.  In the
      introduction to a 2003 essay on Tomaselli’s work in Parkett magazine,
      curator James Rondeau writes: “Over the course of the last ten years, Fred
      Tomaselli has established an international reputation for his meticulously
      crafted, richly detailed, deliriously beautiful works of both abstract and
      figurative art.  His signature pieces are compelling, hybrid objects:
      ersatz, or maybe surrogate paintings, or tapestries, or quilts or
      mosaics.  Their various components—both over-the-counter and controlled
      pharmaceuticals, street drugs, natural psychotropic substances and other
      organic matter, collaged elements from printed sources, and hand-painted
      ornament—are all suspended in gleaming layers of clear, polished, hard
      resin. Forms implode, explode, oscillate, buzz, loop, swirl, and
      spiral.  Actual objects, photographic representations, and painted
      surfaces co-exist without hierarchy on and in a single picture plane.  The
      combined effect, neither determinably real nor fully illusionistic, is at
      once electrifying and destabilizing.”"
