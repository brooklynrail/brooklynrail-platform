short_bio: "**Cecilia Vicuña** is a poet, artist, activist and filmmaker whose
  work addresses pressing concerns of the modern world, including ecological
  destruction, human rights, and cultural homogenization. Born and raised in
  Santiago de Chile, she has been in exile since the early 1970s. She coined the
  term “Arte Precario” in the mid-1960s in Chile, as an independent and
  non-colonized category for her precarious works composed of debris, structures
  that disappear in the landscape, which include her quipus (knot in Quechua),
  envisioned as poems in space. The author of more than 30 books, Vicuña is the
  recipient of numerous awards, and solo exhibitions of her work have been held
  at a number of major institutions, most recently the Museo de Bellas Artes,
  Santiago de Chile (2023)."
