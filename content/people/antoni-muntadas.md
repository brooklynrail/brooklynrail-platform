last_name: Muntadas
short_bio: "**Antoni Muntadas's** works address social, political and
  communications issues, and the relationship between public and private space
  within social frameworks. He investigates channels of information and the ways
  they may be used to censor central information or promulgate ideas. Since
  1995, Muntadas has grouped together a set of works and projects titled *On
  Translation*. Their content, dimensions and materials are highly diverse, and
  they all focus on the authorâ€™s personal experience and artistic activity in
  numerous countries over a period of forty years. By grouping such works
  together under this epigraph, Muntadas places them within a body of experience
  and concrete concerns regarding communication, the culture of our times and
  the role of the artist and art in contemporary society."
