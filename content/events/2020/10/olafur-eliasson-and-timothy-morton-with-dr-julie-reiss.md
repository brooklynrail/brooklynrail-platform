      Eliasson was born in 1967. He grew up in Iceland and Denmark and studied
      from 1989 to 1995 at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. In 1995, he
      moved to Berlin and founded Studio Olafur Eliasson, which today comprises
      a large team of craftsmen, architects, archivists, researchers,
      administrators, cooks, programmers, art historians, and specialized
      technicians.


      Olafur Eliasson’s art is driven by his interests in perception, movement, embodied experience, and feelings of self. He strives to make the concerns of art relevant to society at large. Art, for him, is a crucial means for turning thinking into doing in the world. Eliasson’s works span sculpture, painting, photography, film, and installation. Not limited to the confines of the museum and gallery, his practice engages the broader public sphere through architectural projects, interventions in civic space, arts education, policy-making, and issues of sustainability and climate change.


      In 2019 Eliasson was appointed Goodwill Ambassador for renewable energy and climate action by the United Nations Development Programme. Eliasson lives and works in Copenhagen and Berlin.
