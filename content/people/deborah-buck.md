short_bio: "Exhibiting professionally since the 1980s, **Deborah Buck** has
  shown recently in The Hamptons, Hartford, CT, and New York City. She explores
  the interplay of surrealism and abstraction in her work, where interests in
  absurdity, romanticism, and the darker side of fairy tales lend a strong
  narrative sense to her practice. Deborah opened Buck House (2001 - 2012), a
  fine art and furniture gallery, which hosted gatherings of the art and design
  communities. Deborah remains an instrumental part in New York’s arts education
  as both member of the faculty at School of Visual Arts Master’s of Design
  Program and as a Trustee of The Pratt Institute. "
