[V﻿isit *Trevor Paglen: You've Just Been F*cked by PSYOPS*, on view at PACE Gallery through July 22, 2023 →](https://www.pacegallery.com/exhibitions/trevor-paglen-new-york/)

Yaara Bou Melhem’s documentary Unseen Skiesexplores the evolution of state and corporate surveillance. Her docu-journey follows Trevor Paglen, one of the 21st century’s most visionary artists, on one of his most audacious projects to date - the launching of an artwork into space to show that our skies are more than the exclusive playground of the military-industrial complex. Or are they?
