short_bio: "The paintings of **Tunji Adeniyi-Jones** emerge from a perspective
  of what the artist describes as ‘cultural addition, combination and
  collaboration’. Born and educated in the UK and now living and working in the
  USA, his practice is inspired by the ancient history of West Africa and its
  attendant mythology, and by his Yoruba heritage.  Addressing the perception of
  the black body within Western painting – and in particular, its association
  with physicality – Adeniyi-Jones uses the body as both narrative instrument
  and primary tool of communication. Emphasising the importance of dance and
  body language in a continent where over 1000 languages co-exist, his works
  site the figure at the fulcrum of contemporary diasporic identity."
