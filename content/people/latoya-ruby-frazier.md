  photography, video, and performance to document personal and social histories
  in the United States, specifically the industrial heartland. Frazier employs a
  radically intimate, black-and-white documentary approach that captures the
  complexity, injustice, and simultaneous hope of the Black American experience,
  often utilizing her camera and the medium of photography as an agent for
  social change."
