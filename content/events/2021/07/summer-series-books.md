This summer, we are celebrating the sections of the *Brooklyn Rail* with conversations, performances, and readings curated by our editors. This 2-week YouTube video series offers a view behind the scenes with the editors, artists, and writers that make the publication.

On Thursday, July 22, Books editor Joseph Salvatore is joined by authors John Domini, Yvonne C. Garrett, Tony Leuzzi, Tanjil Rashid, and Andrea Scrima for a conversation on the passions and rationales of book criticism at this moment.
