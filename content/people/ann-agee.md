short_bio: "**Ann Agee** is a leading member in a pioneering generation of
  feminist ceramicists who have brought the art form to the forefront of
  contemporary discourses on sculpture. Through her practice, Agee engages
  ambiguous delineations between fine art, design, and craft; histories of
  cultural appropriation and exchange; and the range of women’s lived
  experiences. She earned her BFA from the Cooper Union School of Art in 1981
  and her MFA from the Yale School of Art in 1986. Her work has been included in
  notable group exhibitions, including: 1994’s _Bad Girls_, the New Museum, NY;
  2009’s _Dirt on Delight_, the Institute of Contemporary Art, PA and the Walker
  Art Center, MN; and 2008’s _Conversations in Clay_, the Katonah Art Museum,
  NY. "
