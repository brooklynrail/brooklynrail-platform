short_bio: "**Penny Arcade**  is an internationally respected performance
  artist, writer, poet and experimental theater maker known for her magnetic
  stage presence, her take-no-prisoners wit, and her content rich plays and one
  liners. She is the author of ten scripted performance plays and hundreds of
  performance art pieces. Her work has always focused on the other and the
  outsider, giving voice to those marginalized by society. Her willingness to
  speak truth to power at the expense of career concerns has made her an
  international icon of artistic resistance. Her decades-long focus on the
  creation of community and inclusion as the goals of performance and her
  efforts to use performance as a transformative act mark her as a true original
  in American theatre and performance."
