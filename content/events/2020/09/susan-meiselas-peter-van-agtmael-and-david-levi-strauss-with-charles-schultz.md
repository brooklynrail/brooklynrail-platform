    event_bio: Peter van Agtmael is known for his deeply affecting, sometimes
      surreal images, which explore themes of conflict, history, memory,
      nationalism, militarism, race and class. He has spent more than ten years
      covering America’s wars from both sides and countless angles, from
      embedding with military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan to covering the
      civilian cost of the wars. He has also extensively documented the
      Israel/Palestine conflict. Van Agtmael was born in Washington DC in 1981.
      He was aged 20 and studying history at Yale when during 9/11; an event
      that would be pivotal in shaping his career. Shortly after graduating, he
      began documenting America’s conflicts, which continue to be the anchor of
      his work.

    event_bio: "David Levi Strauss is one of the most urgent and critical art
      writers working today. “The historical record shows clearly that if you
      try to suppress images, they will come back to haunt you,” Strauss writes
      in our July 2014 issue, “This is the history of iconoclasm—it really
      doesn’t work. There are things that people will not accept and will not
      believe unless they see an image of it. That is so deeply embedded in the
      human response to the visible world and the world of appearances and the
      world inside our heads that this is not going to change. The trouble is
      that these responses are often unconscious, way below the surface, and
      beyond what is easily accessed, which is what makes images so powerful and
      so able to control us.” ⁠ David Levi Strauss’s work focuses on the
      intersection between image and text, and the third space that is created
      through that interaction. He has published a book of poetry, titled
      Manoeuvres: Poems 1977-1979, four collections of essays, titled Between
      Dog & Wolf: Essays on Art & Politics, Between the Eyes: Essays on
      Photography and Politics, From Head to Hand: Art and the Manual, Words Not
      Spent Today Buy Smaller Images Tomorrow: Essays on the Present and Future
      of Photography, and founded and co-edited ACTS: A Journal of New Writing.
      His latest work is Co-illusion: Dispatches from the End of Communication,
      published March 6, exposing a new “iconopolitics,” in which words and
      images lose their connection to reality.⁠"
