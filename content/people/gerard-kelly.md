short_bio: "**Brennan Gerard** (b. Piqua, OH, 1978) and **Ryan Kelly** (b.
  Drums, PA, 1979) were both Van Lier Fellows of the Whitney Museum Independent
  Study Program and later each received an Interdisciplinary Studio MFA at UCLA.
  Gerard & Kelly began collaborating in 2003 and employ multiple
  disciplines—performance, video, and installation—to examine questions of
  collective and individual memory, gender and sexuality, queer subjectivity,
  and the relationship between dance and visual art. Recent solo exhibitions and
  performances of their work have also been held at MAMCO Genève (2020), MOCA,
  Los Angeles (2020), Festival d'Automne, Paris (2017 and 2019), and elsewhere.
  Recent group exhibitions include FRAC Franche-Comté, Besancon (2022) and
  Chicago Architecture Biennial (2017), among others."
