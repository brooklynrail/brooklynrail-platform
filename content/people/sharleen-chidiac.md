short_bio: Dance artist, performer, and musician **Sharleen Chidiac** is based
  in Brooklyn. Her work investigates her curiosities about movement, theater,
  geography, children, and stillness. In her work she tries to explore something
  personal, something emotional, something human, something that connects us
  all. She earnestly believes performance holds a supernatural power that allows
  us to confront our deepest joys and sorrows. Her work has been shown at BAM
  Fisher, Otion Front Studio, Secret Project Robot, amongst other venues
  throughout New York City.
