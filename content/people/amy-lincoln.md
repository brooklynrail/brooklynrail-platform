short_bio: "Born in Bloomington, Indiana in 1981, New York-based artist *Amy
  Lincoln* paints dream-like scenes of imagined landscapes, atmospheric activity
  and vibrant, fantastical foliage. Recalling her upbringing in Oregon, where
  beach visits under overcast skies were frequent, Lincoln’s paintings explore
  the phenomena of light reflection and refraction. She completed her MFA at
  Temple University’s Tyler School of Art in 2006 and her BA at University of
  California, Davis in 2003. Lincoln’s work has been the subject of solo
  exhibitions at Sperone Westwater (2023; 2021), Taymour Grahne Projects, London
  (2022), Morgan Lehman Gallery, New York (2018; 2016) and Monya Rowe Gallery,
  Saint Augustine, FL (2016), among others. "
