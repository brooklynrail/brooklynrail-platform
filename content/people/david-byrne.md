short_bio: "**David Byrne** was raised in Baltimore where he briefly attended
  the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) in 1971 after transferring from
  the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence. Byrne studied photography,
  performance, and video production at MICA. In 1975 Byrne co-founded the group
  Talking Heads, who in the 80s introduced an innovative visual approach to
  their performances. Byrne has been involved with photography, drawing,
  installations, performance and design since college and has been publishing
  and exhibiting his work since the 1990s. Like his music, Byrneâ€™s visual work
  has the capacity to elevate and transform ordinary elements into iconic ones
  and challenges our fundamental notions of what can be classified as art. Byrne
  lives and works in New York City."
