short_bio: "Established in London in 2013 by Daniel Fern√°ndez Pascual and Alon
  Schwabe, **Cooking Sections** examines the systems that organise the world
  through food. Using site-responsive installation, performance and video, they
  explore the overlapping boundaries between art, architecture, ecology and
  geopolitics. They have worked on multiple iterations of the long-term
  site-responsive _CLIMAVORE_ project since 2015, exploring how to eat as humans
  change climates. Their work has been exhibited at Tate Britain and Serpentine
  Galleries, among many others. They are part of British Art Show 9, lead a
  studio unit at the Royal College of Art, London, and were guest professors at
  the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. Among other awards, Cooking Sections were
  nominated for the Turner Prize in 2021. "
