short_bio: "**BINT**  is an interdisciplinary artist and musician based in
  Brooklyn. Working across visual, performance and sound art, BINT applies
  contemporary methods to the traditional multicultural technologies of her
  ancestries (Pakistani, Egyptian, American, etc). With a focus on inherited
  metaphysical tech, her work is interested in the perennial role of the
  artist-mystic in cultural preservation and liberation work. BINT is founder of
  The Barzakh, a podcast and educational platform focused on the revival and
  reclamation of Islam’s rich heritage of the occult and metaphysics. She has
  shown work internationally including performance art commissions for Black
  Sabbath, the Copro Gallery, Atelier de Mélusine and visual work at Coachella
  Music and Arts Festival."
