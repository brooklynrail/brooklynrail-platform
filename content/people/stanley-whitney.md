short_bio: "**Stanley Whitney** was born in Philadelphia in 1946 and lives and
  works in New York City and Parma, Italy. He holds a BFA from Kansas City Art
  Institute as well as an MFA from Yale University and was Professor emeritus of
  painting and drawing at Tyler School of Art, Temple University. Whitney has
  been exploring the formal possibilities of colour within ever-shifting grids
  of multi-hued blocks and all-over fields of gestural marks and passages, since
  the mid-1970s. Taking his cues from early Minimalism, Color Field painters,
  jazz music and his favourite historical artists – Titian, Velázquez and
  Cézanne among them – Whitney is as much an exponent of the process-based,
  spatially-gridded square in art as Josef Albers, Sol LeWitt, and Agnes
  Martin."
