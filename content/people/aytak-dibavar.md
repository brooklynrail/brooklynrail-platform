short_bio: "**Aytak Dibavar** (she/they) is an Iranian activist, artist, and
  professor of Gender and Social Justice at McMaster University, Canada. Aytakâ€™s
  work/research are entangled with feminist, queer, decolonial, and anti-racist
  knowledge production as well as creative/art-based teaching practices. She
  researches and writes about race, gender, memory, political trauma and
  silence. Aytak has a great passion for people and their lived experiences. She
  is interested in life-narratives; how individuals navigate and interpret their
  own stories, including whether and how they choose to share them with others
  or remain silent. As an artist, Aytak not only finds solace and
  self-expression through painting and poetry but also incorporates these art
  forms into their daily life and pedagogical practices."
