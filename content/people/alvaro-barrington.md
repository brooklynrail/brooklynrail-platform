short_bio: "**Alvaro Barrington** (b. 1983, Caracas, Venezuela) paints vivid
  abstractions that consider the cultural production of subjects ranging from
  Hibiscus flowers to the life of Marcus Garvey. Raised between Brooklyn and the
  Caribbean, Barrington utilizes cross-disciplinary materials and crafts that
  often reference his childhood, including the sewing of his Grenadian aunts as
  well as his current life in Europe. In his early work Barrington experimented
  with “copying” artists like Willem de Kooning, Henry Taylor, and Howard
  Hodgkin. The influence of such artists, whose work Barrington highlighted in a
  2019 show he curated entitled _Artists I Steal From_ at Galerie Thaddeus Ropac
  in London, can be felt in the bold, gestural quality of his compositions."
