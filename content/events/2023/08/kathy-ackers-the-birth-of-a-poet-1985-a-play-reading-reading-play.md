In the fall of 1985 *The Birth of a Poet* premiered at the Brooklyn Academy of Music Opera House as part of BAM's Next Wave Festival. Billed as a landmark operatic collaboration between prominent figures of the New York avant-garde (with costumes and sets by David Salle, music by Peter Gordon, direction by Richard Foreman, and a playtext by Kathy Acker), the piece quickly became infamous. Allegedly most of the audience left during the first performance and those that stayed for the curtain call booed aggressively. *Artforum* referred to the performance as "confusingly incoherent" and an "empty Warholian fart of impotent hooey," while the *New York Times* called it "a mess" that "fails decisively." For this iteration of the Brooklyn Rail's *New Social Environment,* the musician and author Ethan Philbrick gathers the artists Sophia Giovannitti and Elliot Reed to revisit this notorious collaboration by staging an informal remote reading of a distilled version of Acker's libretto before having a conversation about collaboration, performance, politics, and sex.
