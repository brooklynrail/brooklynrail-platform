    event_bio: "Alexander Nagel is Professor at the Institute of Fine Arts, NYU. His
      interest in art and religious reform produced Michelangelo and the Reform
      of Art (2000, winner of the Renaissance Society of America’s Gordan book
      prize), and The Controversy of Renaissance Art (2011, winner of the
      College Art Association’s Morey book prize). His interest in the multiple
      temporalities of art led to the publication of Anachronic Renaissance
      (co-authored with Christopher Wood, 2010) and Medieval Modern: Art out of
      Time (2012). His current work addresses questions of orientation and
      configurations of place in Renaissance art and culture. In 2016, he
      received an NEH Fellowship for a collaborative project (with Elizabeth
      Horodowich, NMSU) entitled Amerasia: A Renaissance Discovery."

In his fresh take on abstract art, noted art historian Pepe Karmel chronicles the movement from a global perspective, while embedding abstraction in a recognizable reality. Moving beyond the canonical terrain of abstract art, the author demonstrates how artists from around the world have used abstract imagery to express social, cultural, and spiritual experience.

Karmel builds this fresh approach to abstract art around five inclusive themes: body, landscape, cosmology, architecture, and man-made signs and patterns. In the process, this history develops a series of narratives that go far beyond the established figures and movements traditionally associated with abstract art. Each narrative is complemented by a number of featured abstract works, arranged in thought-provoking pairings with accompanying extended captions that provide an in-depth analysis. This wide-ranging examination incorporates work from Asia, Australia, Africa, and South America, as well as Europe and North America, through artists ranging from Wu Guanzhong, Joan Miró, Jackson Pollock, to Hilma af Klint, and Odili Donald Odita. Breaking new ground, Karmel has forged a new history of this key art movement.
