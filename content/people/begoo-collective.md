short_bio: A collective of Iranian feminists inside and outside of Iran, **Begoo
  Collective**is invested in cultivating a transnational dialogue, particularly
  among the people of the Global South, in solidarity with the uprising of the
  Iranian people, especially Womxn, the LGBTQ+, and all marginalized
  communities. Centering JIN JÎYAN AZADÎ (Woman, Life, Freedom) and in a fight
  against systemic historical erasure, through a feminist, anti-colonial, and
  transnational lens, Begoo Collective strives to amplify the Iranian people's
  acts of bravery and resistance, and to archive the violence and the oppression
  their bodies continue to endure.
