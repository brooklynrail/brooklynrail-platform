short_bio: "Nigerian-born writer and painter **Yemisi Aribisala** is currently
  based in London. Her first book, _Longthroat Memoirs: Soups Sex & Nigerian
  Tastebuds_, used Nigerian food as a literary substrate to think about
  Nigeria’s culture and society. It won a Gourmand’s World Cookbook award, was
  shortlisted for the 2018 Art of Eating Prize and won the 2016 John Avery Prize
  at the Andre Simon Book Awards. Her writing explores various topics including
  feminism, Nigerian Christianity and identity and her essays on food are a lens
  through which the complex entity of Nigeria can be observed."
