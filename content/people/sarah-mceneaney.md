short_bio: Born in Munich, Germany, Philadelphia-based artist **Sarah
  McEneaney** received a certificate of painting from the Pennsylvania Academy
  of the Fine Arts and studied at Philadelphia College of the Arts. Her
  autobiographical subject matter renders people, places, and things with
  vibrant, meticulous and detailed brushwork characteristic of the acrylic
  medium in which she often paints. Sarah’s paintings are an invitation into the
  story of a life lived. McEneaney’s work is in numerous collections and she has
  had regular solo gallery exhibitions in New York since 2001 and Philadelphia
  since 1979. She has been awarded artist residencies at Ballinglen Arts
