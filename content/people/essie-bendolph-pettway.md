short_bio: "**Essie Bendolph Pettway** (born 1956), the only daughter of Mary
  Lee Bendolph, began quilting at the age of eight. Although trained by her
  mother, Essie developed a distinctive style and was producing accomplished
  quilts while still in her teens. She has worked for many years making uniforms
  for the armed forces. Her highly practiced sewing skills enable her to tackle
  complex quilt patterns and introduce subtle optical effects into them. Over
  the years, she also has created a number of quilts that incorporate camouflage
  patterns from her day job. Essie is among the last women in Geeâ€™s Bend to
  continue practicing her craft."
