short_bio: Interdisciplinary artist **Dread Scott** (b. 1965, Chicago, IL)
  creates work that encourages viewers to re-examine cohering ideals of American
  society. In 1989, the US Senate outlawed his artwork and President Bush
  declared it \"disgraceful\" because of its transgressive use of the American
  flag. Dread became part of a landmark Supreme Court case when he and others
  burned flags on the steps of the Capitol, about which he has presented a TED
  talk. His art has been exhibited at MoMA/PS1, CAM St. Louis, Kunsthal KAdE
  (Amersfoort, Netherlands) and many others. In 2021, Scott received the John
  Simon Guggenheim Fellowship. This past December, ARTnews named his NFT _White
  Male for Sale_ a defining artwork of 2021. His studio is in Brooklyn, NY.
