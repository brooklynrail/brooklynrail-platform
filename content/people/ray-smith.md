short_bio: Painter and sculptor Ray Smith was born in Brownsville, Texas in
  1959, on lands that his family had settled in the early 19th century. He
  studied fresco painting with traditional craftsmen in Mexico, attended art
  academies in Mexico and the United States, and settled in Mexico City. Since
  1985, he has divided his time between New York and Cuernavaca, Mexico. Smith’s
  work is characterized by a unique kind of magical realism. He bends, twists,
  and transplants, creating illogical scenarios that are full of surprises and
  special effects. The artist often uses dogs and animals as anthropomorphic
  beings. “They are an entity of the human figure,” says Smith. “They are
  beasts, but they are directly attached to a blueprint of our own existence.”
