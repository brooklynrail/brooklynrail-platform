short_bio: As an organizer with the Communist Party USA/Young Communist League,
  Brooklyn Eviction Defense,Crown Heights Tenant's Union, Sister's In The
  Struggle, and Flatbush Tenant's Coalition, **Khadija Haynes'** heart lies in
  lifting her community-and all working class people-out of the dispossessory
  conditions capital breeds. As a Trinidadian born Afro-caribbean woman poet and
  writer, her life's work, and ultimate goal, is to help continue lifting the
  consciousness of the people through the lens of the black radical
  Marxist-leninist tradition; aiding them in better understanding how their own
  socioeconomic and oftentimes psychological problems, are directly related to
  the overall inherently oppressive nature of this system and not a result of
  individual shortcomings.
