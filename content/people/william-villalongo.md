short_bio: "**William Villalongo** (b. 1975) strategically uses imagery and
  material to collage a comprehensive representation of the Black identity. The
  artistâ€™s kaleidoscopic conversation of signs and symbols explore themes of
  diaspora, Deep Time, freedom, and transformation. In 2024, Villalongo will
  have a solo museum exhibition originating at the Grinnell College Museum of
  Art, Grinnell, IA, traveling to the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art,
  Madison, WI; Museum of Art, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO; and
  Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He is the recipient
  of the 2022 Rome Prize, the Louis Comfort Tiffany Award, and the Joan Mitchell
  Foundation Painters & Sculptors Grant."
