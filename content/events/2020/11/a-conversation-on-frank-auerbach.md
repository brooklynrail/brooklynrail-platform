Luhring Augustine Chelsea is pleased to present a solo exhibition of **[Frank Auerbach](https://www.luhringaugustine.com/exhibitions/frank-auerbach-selected-works-1978-2016/virtual-tour)’s** paintings and drawings, celebrating the mature career of a singular artist. Spanning from the late 1970s to recent works, the selection of his portraits and landscapes on view underscore Auerbach’s great achievements in painting in the post-war era. The first show of his work in New York of this scale since 2006, the exhibition will be on view through February 20, 2021 and accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue.

Auerbach’s work exists outside of any specific period or style. Employing an energetic impasto technique to render his subjects, he creates figurative paintings through an intensive daily regimen. The exhibition highlights portraits of a group of his devoted sitters, some of whom he has been painting since the 1970s and still pose for him regularly today. The paintings are often the result of months of labor: at the end of a day of work, he will frequently scrape down the entire surface of the piece in order to start anew in his next attempt; each rejected endeavor a pursuit toward the final expression. The landscape paintings are derived from sketches Auerbach makes in locations close to Mornington Crescent in Camden Town, London, the area near the studio where he has worked since 1954. With his distinct idiom Auerbach imagines the quotidian scenes of parks, streets, and buildings around his familiar neighborhood.
