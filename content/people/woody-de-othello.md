short_bio: "Miami-born, California-based artist **Woody De Othello**'s subject
  matter spans household objects, bodily features, and the natural world.
  Everyday artifacts of the domestic tables, chairs,  television remotes,
  telephone receivers, lamps, air purifiers, etc.—are anthropomorphized in
  glazed ceramic, bronze, wood, and  glass. Othello’s sense of humor manifests
  across his work in visual puns and cartoonish figuration. “I choose objects
  that are already very human,” says Othello. “The objects mimic actions that
  humans perform; they’re extensions of our own actions. We use phones to  speak
  and to listen, clocks to tell time, vessels to hold things, and  our bodies
  are indicators of all of those.” "
