short_bio: "Known for his work across a variety of mediums, including texts and
  curatorial projects, **Sanya Kantarovsky**'s multifaceted approach often
  results in artworks that seem forced to reckon with their own embarrassment.
  The dark humor consistent in Kantarovsky’s work pits the sumptuous against the
  abject and thrusts private space—be it physical or psychological—into public
  view. Kantarovsky’s figurative paintings contain drastic shifts in scale,
  paint application, and stylization. Similarly, the artist probes his art
  historical predecessors: both canonical and relatively unknown painters,
  writers, and illustrators. The presence of these muses, which dot
  Kantarovsky’s compositions, simultaneously questions and indulges in a lineage
  of painterly impulses."
