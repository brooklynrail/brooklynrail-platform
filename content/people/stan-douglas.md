short_bio: "Since the late 1980s, Stan Douglas has created films and
  photographs—and more recently theater productions and other multidisciplinary
  projects—that investigate the parameters of their medium. His ongoing inquiry
  into technology's role in image making, and how those mediations infiltrate
  and shape collective memory, has resulted in works that are at once specific
  in their historical and cultural references and broadly accessible. Douglas
  was born in 1960 in Vancouver, where he continues to live and work. Douglas
  was one of the first artists to be represented by David Zwirner, where he had
  his first American solo exhibition in 1993. "
