short_bio: "**Michelle Handelman** is a visual artist/filmmaker/writer who makes
  hypnotic moving image installations that push against the boundaries of
  gender, race and sexuality. Coming up through the years of the AIDS crisis and
  Culture Wars, Handelman has built a body of work that confronts the things we
  collectively fear and deny: sex, death, chaos. Handelman is a 2019 Creative
  Capital Awardee and a 2011 John Simon Guggenheim Fellow. Her work has been
  shown widely in such venues as San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Pompidou
  Centre, Paris; ICA, London; and elsewhere. Her award-winning film
  _BLOODSISTERS: LEATHER, DYKES AND SADOMASOCHISM_ (1995) takes an in-depth look
  at the San Francisco leatherdyke scene during the mid-90s and is recognized as
  a landmark of queer history."
