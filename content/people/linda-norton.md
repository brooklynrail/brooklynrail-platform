short_bio: 'Visual artist and writer **Linda Norton** is the author of _Wite
  Out: Love and Work_ (2020), a memoir with poems, and its prequel, _The Public
  Gardens: Poems and History_ (2011; introduction by Fanny Howe), a finalist for
  a _Los Angeles Times_ Book Prize. John Keene calls _Wite Out_ a “masterpiece”
  and Norman Fischer calls it “a gorgeous, courageous book.” In a recent review
  in the _East Bay Express_, D. Scot Miller calls _Wite Out_ "a must for anyone
  trying to understand the nuanced aggression of systemic oppression and how it
  affects the afflictor and afflicted in equal measure." Norton teaches at IT
  Sligo in Ireland. She was a 2020 columnist-in-residence at SFMoMA’s Open
  Space, where you can read her five essays and see her collages and
  photographs.'
