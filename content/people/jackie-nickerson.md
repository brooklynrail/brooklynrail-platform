short_bio: "An artist and photographer who has began photographing Zimbabwean
  farm workers in 1996 as a way to change the perception that those who work in
  African agriculture are disempowered, unmodern people. The resulting series,
  ‘Farm’, focused on the unique and beautiful clothing the workers made for
  themselves, and by doing so highlighted the worker’s identity, individuality,
  and ultimately their modernism. This was published by Jonathan Cape in
  September 2002. (German edition, ‘Leben Mit Der Erde’, published by Frederking
  and Thaler, 2002; French edition, ‘Une Autre Afrique’, published by
  Flammarion, 2002. Nickerson divides her time between London and rural Ireland.
