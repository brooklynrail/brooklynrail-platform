short_bio: "(b. 1953 Portland, OR; lives and works in Syracuse, NY) is widely
  renowned as one of the most influential contemporary American artists living
  today. Over the course of nearly four decades, Weems has developed a complex
  body of work employing text, fabric, audio, digital images, installation, and
  video, but she is most celebrated as a photographer. Activism is central to
  Weemsâ€™ practice, which investigates race, family relationships, cultural
  identity, sexism, class, political systems, and the consequences of power.
  Over the last 30 years of her prolific career, Weems has been consistently
  ahead of her time and an ongoing presence in contemporary culture. "
