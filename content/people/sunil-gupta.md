short_bio: Over a career spanning more than four decades, **Sunil Gupta** has
  maintained a visionary approach to photography, producing a body of work that
  has pioneered a unique social and political commentary. The artist's diasporic
  experience of multiple cultures informs a practice dedicated to themes of
  race, migration and queer identity. His work is in many public collections,
  including Museum of Modern Art, NY; Tate, UK; Philadelphia Museum of Art, PA,
  among others. In 1989, Gupta co-founded Autograph â€“ the Association of Black
  Photographers, and a few years later he participated in the birth of the
  Organization for Visual Arts (OVA), aimed to promote a better understanding of
  culturally diverse visual arts practices.
