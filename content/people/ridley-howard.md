short_bio: "Born in Atlanta, **Ridley Howard** is a contemporary artist based in
  Brooklyn, known for his large, intimate portraits of anonymous subjects in
  private settings. After graduating from the University of Georgia, he received
  his MFA from Tufts University. Among his oil on linen paintings, his
  soft-focus portraits, such as _The Charm of 5:30,_ suggest an enigmatic
  familiarity, while his abstract geometric landscapes evoke tendencies of early
  20th century Neoplasticism. Howard’s work has been shown in an extensive
  number of solo and group exhibitions. Among them, the Boston Museum of Fine
  Arts is currently showing the exhibit _Ridley Howard: Fields and Stripes_, and
  the Andréhn-Schiptjenko Museum in Stockholm features his work. He is
  represented by Leo Koenig Inc. in New York City."
