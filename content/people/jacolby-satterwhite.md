short_bio: "**Jacolby Satterwhite** was born in 1986 in Columbia, South Carolina
  and currently lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. Satterwhite is celebrated for a
  conceptual practice addressing crucial themes of labor, consumption, carnality
  and fantasy through immersive installation, virtual reality and digital media.
  He uses a range of software to produce intricately detailed animations and
  live action film of real and imagined worlds populated by the avatars of
  artists and friends. These animations serve as the stage on which the artist
  synthesizes the multiple disciplines that encompass his practice, namely
  illustration, performance, painting, sculpture, photography and writing. "
