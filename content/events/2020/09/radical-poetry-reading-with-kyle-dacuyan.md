  - person: tc-tolbert
    event_bio: "Hey y’all! My name is TC Tolbert (he/him/hey grrrl!). Instead of a
      bio, here are a few things I’d prefer to share: I like walking up a
      mountain more than walking down; on the Enneagram I'm a 1; I'm a
      Capricorn; learning is infinitely more interesting to me than knowing
      (scarier, too); with my partner, I am wildly blessed to care for two pit
      bulls; I am white and was born and raised a girl in Hixson, TN as a
      speaking-in-tongues Pentecostal and I eventually came out as queer,
      feminist, anti-racist, and trans-masc; I now live in Tucson, which
      occupies the traditional territories of the Tohono O’odham and Pascua
      Yaqui peoples; I never cease to experience simultaneous grief and deep
      love any time I pay attention to the world. I'm wild with gratitude for
      the space and time to be with all of you."
