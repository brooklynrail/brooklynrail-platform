short_bio: "**Oliver Beer** creates sculptures, installations, videos, and
  immersive live performances that reveal the hidden properties and musicality
  of objects, bodies, and architectural sites. His social and familial
  relationships often become the blueprint for multidisciplinary works that
  engage with intimate and universal concerns, such as the transmission of
  musical memories. Beer’s sculptural practice dissects the material world and
  the traces we leave on it by slicing and reassembling common objects to create
  new meanings and forms. The artist’s work has been the subject of many solo
  and group exhibitions, notably at Metropolitan Museum of Art and MoMA PS1, New
  York; London Mithraeum Bloomberg SPACE, London; Centre Pompidou, Paris, and
  elsewhere. "
