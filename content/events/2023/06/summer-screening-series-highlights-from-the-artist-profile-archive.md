[](https://brooklynrail.org/events/2022/08/12/charles-gaines-the-american-manifest/)[](https://creativetime.org/american-manifest-part-two/)The Artist Profile Archive is an ever-expanding online archive of short documentaries on contemporary artists. The videos profile artists in their own words and include multi-media content featuring biographies, exhibition photos, audio clips and behind-the-scenes images. They provide educational information and an historical record of some of the most important contemporary artists working today.

 Artists are interviewed in their studios and speak extemporaneously about their educational background, sources of inspiration and their artistic practice, often contextualizing current or upcoming exhibitions in major cities and museums around the world. These intimate portraits allow the audience to make a personal connection to the featured artists, promoting a more textured understanding of their work. To date, The Artist Profile Archive has profiled over 30 contemporary artists, including Alice Aycock, Lita Albuquerque, Eric Fischl, Charles Gaines, Dan Graham, Virginia Jaramillo, Robert Longo, Arcmanoro Niles, Yinka Shonibare, Marnie Weber, Letha Wilson and more.
