  artist **Ana Rosa Rivera Marrero** graduated from the Puerto Rico School of
  Plastic Arts in 1992 with a degree in sculpture and then took graduate courses
  in sculpture and art criticism at the Yale School of Art in Connecticut. Since
  the 1990s she has been involved in countless group and solo projects,
  including public art installations, and her work has been included in some

  videos, and mixed-media constructions, which, in combination, lend added
  significance to her works.
