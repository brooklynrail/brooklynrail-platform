short_bio: "**David Hinton** has published numerous books of poetry and essays,
  and many translations of ancient Chinese poetry and philosophy that create
  contemporary works of compelling literary power, while also conveying the
  actual texture and density of the originals. These books are all informed by
  an abiding interest in deep ecological thinking, in exploring the weave of
  consciousness and landscape. This work has earned wide aclaim and many
  national awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship and both of the major
  awards given for poetry translation in the United States: the Landon
  Translation Award (Academy of American Poets) and the PEN American Translation
  Award. Most recently, Hinton received a lifetime achievement award from the
  American Academy of Arts and Letters."
