short_bio: Since the late 1960s, Robert Wilson's productions have decisively
  shaped the look of theater and opera. Through his signature use of light, his
  investigations into the structure of a simple movement, and the classical
  rigor of his scenic and furniture design, Wilson has continuously articulated
  the force and originality of his vision. Wilson's close ties and
  collaborations with leading artists, writers, and musicians continue to
  fascinate audiences worldwide.
