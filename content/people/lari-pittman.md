short_bio: Over the course of his decades-long career, **Lari Pittman** has
  developed a unique visual aesthetic that has established him as one of the
  most significant painters of his generation. Pittman’s signature,
  densely-layered painting style includes a lexicon of signs and symbols (such
  as bells, eggs, animals, and ropes), a compilation of varied painting
  techniques, and a clear homage to the handmade, craft, and the decorative.
  While Pittman’s early works were informed by the socio-political struggle
  resulting from the peak of the AIDS epidemic, racial discord, and LGBTQ+ civil
  rights struggles that defined the last two decades of the 20th century, his
  later paintings evince a shift in focus towards interior spaces, including
  domestic and psychological subjects.
