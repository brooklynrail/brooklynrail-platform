On behalf of the entire Brooklyn Rail staff and community, we extend our
heartfelt thanks for your generous contribution to our year end fundraising drive.

This is our 25th year as a non-profit arts organization & independent publication, your support is a vote of confidence in our mission, and stakes our shared claim to a space that will always stand for inclusive and critical voices.

Individual contributions like yours are a huge part of our support system, and will allow us to innovate and launch timely projects such as The New Social Environment, We The Immigrants, and our Singing in Unison exhibition series while compensating the artists & poets who do the work.

With your support, we are poised to grow with greater clarity and commitment to produce, expand, and improve our unique vision.

We thank you for your enthusiasm and friendship.

Yours, in solidarity,

— The Brooklyn Rail :heart: :rainbow:

Founded in October 2000, the [Brooklyn Rail](https://brooklynrail.org/) provides an independent forum for arts, culture, and politics throughout New York City and far beyond.

Our journal features criticism of visual art, music, dance, film, theater and literature, alongside thoughtful political commentary and original fiction and poetry.

The Rail is distributed free of charge both in print and online, and further fulfills its mission by curating art exhibitions, panel discussions, reading series and film screenings that reflect the complexity and inventiveness of the city’s
artistic and cultural landscape. [Learn more »](https://brooklynrail.org/about)
