short_bio: "A transdisciplinary artist whose work explores how different social,
  technological, and cognitive processes shape and control the ways that we
  understand the world around and within us. Vadera's practice is influenced by
  cognitive science, post/de-colonial theory, science fiction, and Buddhist
  philosophy. Vadera's paintings, prints, photographs, videos, and installations
  have been exhibited and screened internationally at venues such as: the Queens
  Museum, MoMA, the Smithsonian APAC, Asia Society, Aga Khan Museum, Bhau Daji
  Lad Museum, and the Maraya Art Centre. In parallel, Vadera has worked as a
  curator, programmer, and writer on projects that focus on art as a catalyst
  for social change. Jaret lives and works between New York, Toronto, and India.
  Vadera is currently based in New York."
