short_bio: In his paintings, drawings, sculptures, and mixed-media works, **Joe
  Bradley** has produced a visual language that oscillates freely between
  personal and art historical references. Constantly reinventing himself, he
  cycles through some of the most iconic modes of abstraction, investigating
  Minimalist questions of color and form, tapping into the spontaneous gesture
  of Abstract Expressionism, and creating cryptic signs and symbols in
  ingenious, lively drawings.
