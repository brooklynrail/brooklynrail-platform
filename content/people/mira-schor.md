short_bio: 'A New York based painter and writer. Her work is steeped in the
  political, the historical, the personal, and the material; in other periods
  her work focused on representation of language in drawing and painting. Recent
  work focuses on the experience of living in a moment of radical inequality,
  climate and political catastrophe, and accelerated time, set against the
  powerful pull of older notions of time, craft, and visual pleasure. She is
  author of "A Decade of Negative Thinking: Essays on Art, Politics, and Daily
  Life" and several other titles. She was co-founder and co-editor with Susan
  Bee of the journal and editorial project M/E/A/N/I/N/G. In 2017 she was
  elected to the National Academy. She is represented by Lyles & King Gallery.'
