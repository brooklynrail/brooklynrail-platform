short_bio: "**Robert Cozzolino** is an independent curator, art historian, and
  critic based in Minneapolis. He curates collaboratively, in partnership with
  artists, colleagues, and broad communities. Although he has worked on topics
  from the 19th and 20th centuries, he regularly works with contemporary artists
  in examining history. He considers himself a curator of fluid time, not bound
  to the labels and bins imposed on the field. He has curated over 40
  exhibitions, including _Supernatural America: The Paranormal in American Art_,
  _World War I and American Art_, _Peter Blume: Nature and Metamorphosis_,
  _David Lynch: The Unified Field_, and many others."
