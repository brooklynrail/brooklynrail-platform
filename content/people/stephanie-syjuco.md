short_bio: "**Stephanie Syjuco** works in photography, sculpture, and
  installation, moving from handmade and craft-inspired mediums to digital
  editing and archive excavations. Recently, she has focused on how photography
  and image-based processes are implicated in the construction of racialized,
  exclusionary narratives of history and citizenship. Born in the Philippines,
  she is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and has exhibited at The
  Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the Getty Los
  Angeles, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, among others. She is an
  Associate Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and resides in
  Oakland, California."
