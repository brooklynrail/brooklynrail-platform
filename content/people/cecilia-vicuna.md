short_bio: "Artist-poet **Cecilia Vicuña** created the concept of Precarious Art
  in Chile in 1966, an early response to ecological crisis. Her improvisatory
  performances emphasize indigenous cultural memory and the collective nature of
  action to bring forth justice, balance, and world transformation. Vicuña is
  the author of 27 books. Recent titles include *Cruz del Sur* published by
  Lumen (Penguin/Random House, 2020) in Chile, *Slow Down Fast, a Toda Raja*
  (Errant Bodies Press, 2019), *New and Selected Poems of Cecilia Vicuña*
  (Kelsey Street Press, 2018), and *Read Thread: The Story of the Red Thread*
  (Sternberg Press, 2017)."
