The Festival is an immersive celebration of Floyd Bennett Field through a playful reimagining of space, architecture, and visual storytelling. Original works from artists Derrick Adams, Peter Burr, Eto Otitigbe, Ryan Hartley Smith, and others will be video mapped to the façade of two monumental historic airplane hangars creating an unforgettable visual experience. This family-friendly event also includes live musical performances by Wild Yaks, Sesame Flyers Steel Pan Ensemble, and Batalá, alongside free activities for all ages, a makers market, food trucks, and a silent dance party accompanied by an interactive video performance piece.
