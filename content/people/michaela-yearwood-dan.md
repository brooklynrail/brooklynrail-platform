short_bio: "**Michaela Yearwood-Dan’s** work reflects on subjectivity and
  individual identity as forms of self-determination. Whilst her work may be
  underpinned by an expansive and multivalent repertoire of cultural signifiers
  borrowing freely from Blackness, healing rituals, flora, texting,
  acrylic-nails, gold-hoops, carnival culture, they enable her to present and
  privilege the variance of her own individual experience. As such, her work
  refuses to be framed by narrow expectations of racial or gendered notions of
  collective identity and history. Yearwood-Dan’s work has been exhibited
  internationally and is included in multiple permanent collections. She has
  participated in a range of fellowships and residencies, including the Palazzo
  Monti Residency, Brescia, Italy. She lives and works in London."
