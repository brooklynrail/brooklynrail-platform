*The Brooklyn Rail* is proud to present, in collaboration with The Clemente, a launch party celebrating the *River Rail: Puerto Rico*. This edition of the *River Rail* features artists, writers, scholars, poets, and activists whose work considers the history and future of Puerto Rico and the ongoing recovery efforts since Hurricane Maria in 2017. Fashioned as a love letter to Puerto Rican resiliency and culture, this event will feature musical performances by En Cadenas ([Brandon Lopez](https://www.brandonlopez.nyc/), [Hery Paz](https://www.herypaz.com/about), [Lyle Rivera](https://lylerivera.bandcamp.com/)) and [Son Boricua](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2gLbmzUtK0S8QoeKMBBPNQ) (under the direction of [José Mangual Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mangual_Jr)), a vinyl DJ set by [Diosa Dynamite](https://www.instagram.com/djdiosadynamite/), remarks from the editors Iberia Pérez González and Natalia Viera Salgado, food, drinks, and more.
