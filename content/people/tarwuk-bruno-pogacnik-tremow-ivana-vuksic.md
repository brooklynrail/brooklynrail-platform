short_bio: "TARWUK are a collaborative duo from Croatia who have been working
  together since 2014. They make sculptures and installations that conjure
  unknown rituals and traumatic scenes of war and devastation. They use a range
  of materials—wax, rope, pigments, wood, plaster—to evoke the feeling of having
  just stumbled on a story whose totality will never be told. Their works
  challenge assumptions by imposing personal, speculative stories that create a
  complex and generative system of meaning, materializing their personal
  histories into objects. Their work reflects their upbringing, first in
  socialist Yugoslavia and later in post-socialist Croatia. "
