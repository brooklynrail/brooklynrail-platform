short_bio: "Born in Tsu, Mie Prefecture, Japan, **Leiko Ikemura** emigrated to
  Europe in 1973. A Japanese-Swiss dual citizen, Ikemura has been living and
  working between Berlin and Cologne since 1990. Formative memories from her
  native Japan find as much resonance as the impressions from her early stays in
  Spain and Switzerland in the 1970’s and 80’s, which accompany her to this day.
  The intimate metamorphosis of a lifelong painting process manifests itself in
  landscapes in which human figures and nature merge, amorphous forms and hybrid
  mythical creatures in continuous transformation. Leiko Ikemura's works have
  been presented in solo and group exhibitions worldwide. Most recently, the
  Centro de Arte Caja Burgos exhibited the solo show _Leiko Ikemura: Aun más
  mañanas_ (spring 2021)."
