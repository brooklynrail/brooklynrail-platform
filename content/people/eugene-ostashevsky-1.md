short_bio: "**Eugene Ostashevsky** was born in 1968 in Leningrad, USSR, grew up
  in New York, and now lives mainly in Berlin. His _Feeling Sonnets_, published
  in 2022 by Carcanet in the UK and NYRB Poets in the US, examine the effects of
  speaking a non-native language on emotions, parenting, and identity. As a
  translator of Russian avantgarde literature, Ostashevsky is best known for his
  _OBERIU: An Anthology of Russian Absurdism_ (Northwestern UP, 2006) and
  Alexander Vvedenskyâ€™s _An Invitation for Me to Think_ (with Matvei
  Yankelevich; NYRB Poets, 2013). His translations of contemporary Russophone
  writing include _F Letter: New Russian Feminist Poetry_ (co-edited with
  Ainsley Morse and Galina Rymbu; isolarii, 2020) and _Lucky Breaks_ by Yevgenia
  Belorusets (New Directions, 2022)."
