***Louise Bourgeois: The Spider, the Mistress and the Tangerine*** is a cinematic journey inside the life and imagination of an icon of modern art. As a screen presence, Louise Bourgeois is magnetic, mercurial, and emotionally raw. There is no separation between her life as an artist and the memories and emotions that affect her every day. In 1982, at the age of 71, she became the first woman to be honored with a major retrospective at New York‚Äôs Museum of Modern Art. Filmed with unparalleled access between 1993 and 2007,¬†*Louise Bourgeois: The Spider, the Mistress and the Tangerine* is an intimate engagement with an artist‚Äôs world and ‚Äúa work of art in itself‚Äù (Artforum).

***Ilya and Emilia Kabakov: Enter Here***¬†portrays two of Russia‚Äôs most celebrated international artists, now American citizens, as they come to terms with the new Russia. Two decades after he fled the Soviet Union, Ilya Kabakov overcomes his fears to create six art installations in venues throughout Moscow, where he was once forbidden to exhibit his art. Amidst the cacophony of a city and a country in dizzying transition, he comes face to face with the memories that have made him who he is.

Amei Wallach is beginning post-production on a new feature-length documentary due out next fall:¬†***Taking Venice: The Rauschenberg Factor.*** Against a Cold War backdrop of danger, challenge, and change, the US government and two artworld insiders deploy the forces of power and intrigue to win Grand Prize for America with the disruptive art of Robert Rauschenberg at the 1964 Venice Biennale. The experience, the international outrage, and social upheavals at home transform Rauschenberg into a champion of free expression, the environment, and peace.
