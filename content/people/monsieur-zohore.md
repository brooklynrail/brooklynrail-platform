short_bio: "**Monsieur Zohore** is an Ivorian-American artist based in New York
  and Richmond. His practice is invested in the consumption and digestion of
  culture through the conflation of domestic quotidian labor and art production.
  Through performance, installation, and sculpture, his practices explore queer
  history alongside his Ivorian-American heritage through a multi-faceted lens
  of humor, economics, art history, and labor. "
