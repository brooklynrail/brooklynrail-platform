short_bio: "Writer, poet, performer and scriptwriter **Yaissa Jiménez** is
  addicted to observation.Her essays and opinion pieces explore
  afro-descendants, caribbean issues, feminism and environmental protection.
  _Papaya Ritual_  is her first book, a compendium of rude, “isleña” and
  syncretic poetry. The poems of _Ritual Papaya_ have also been part of
  anthologies such as Isla Escrita, by Amargot Ediciones (Spain),
  Liberoamericanas and The Sea Needs no Ornament (bilingual anthology, English
  and Spanish, Caribbean writers). Another field explored by the author is
  performance, making videos and sharing them on her social networks. Giving the
  voice and intention that she usually overflows with any poem and that revokes
  the limits of the blank page. "
