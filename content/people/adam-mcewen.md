short_bio: "**Adam McEwen’s** work resides somewhere between the celebratory and
  funereal. After writing obituaries for the _Daily Telegraph_ in London, he
  began producing obituaries of living subjects such as Bill Clinton and Jeff
  Koons, highlighting the blurred line between history and fiction. As a
  meditation on the many lives and deaths of art, he has created a space that
  conflates a beleaguered present with the afterlife of a potent and contentious
  moment in art history. McEwen’s dead zone of dark relics and faded memories
  confronts us, literally and metaphysically, with the filthy lucre of our past
  and present. McEwen was born in in London and currently lives and works in New
  York City."
