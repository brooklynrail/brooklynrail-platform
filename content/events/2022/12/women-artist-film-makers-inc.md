{{< image media="2022/12/silvianna-goldsmith-hearts-chains-and-flowers" size="lg" >}}

Filmed from a choreographed eternal B and D triangle, old found erotic footage, optically printed and rear screen rephotograhped with a Matte Box, and hand painted. According to Stekel, in all of us is the will to power and the will to power and the will to submission; every pleasure is close to pain, and in all love there is some hate. To be able to stretch our boundaries and explore our shadow side, here with a bit of black humor, this is part of our new freedoms. –S. G



**Maria Beatty, *Imaging Her Erotics: Carolee Schneemann* (1993, color, sound, 5 min)**

{{< image media="2022/12/maria-beatty-imaging-her-erotics-carolee-schneemann" size="lg" >}}

The result of year's collaboration between Beatty and Schneemann. Beatty's original video sequences intertwine with Schneemann's own vocabulary and visual style, creating a cumulative history from Schneemann's recurrent themes and symbols. Schneemann's command of painting, sculpture, performance and video art, as channels of self-alteration and transgression, provide a provocative look at feminist art history and depictions of sexuality. Her works through the past three decades are central to the art of the 1990s – especially the prevalent view of the body as a site of identity and political struggle. Beatty has created a unique, feminist alternative to the traditional "portrait of an artist."



**Maria Lassnig, *Self Portrait* (1973, color, sound, 5 min)**

{{< image media="2022/12/maria-lassnig-self-portrait" size="lg" >}}

"Maria Lassnig has made a perfectly lovely film entitled SELF PORTRAIT to which I would give first prize. About here own film Ms. Lassnig has written: 'Using my own drawings, realistic, surrealistic or abstract, I have drawn the moods, fears, thoughts and parts of a life story (the drawings were then animated). This self-portrait was done before a mirror without the help of photographs. I also did all camera work and sound.'         – Marcia Cavell, Changes, January, 1973   



**Rosalind Schneider, *Abstraction* (1971, color, sound, 8 min)**

{{< image media="2022/12/rosalind-schneider-abstraction" size="lg" >}}

"Abstraction deals with the interpretation of abstract form as found in the combination of the nude body, landscape, and objects. Imagery is achieved through visual distortion dealing with reflective surfaces, as well as the superimposition of subject matter. The rhythmic structure focuses on a pulsating expansion and contraction that simulates a life force. An attempt has been made to reveal the basic concepts of a painter's approach to the distillation of reality." - RS



**Doris Chase, *Circles II* (1972, color, sound, 14 min)**

{{< image media="2022/12/doris-chase-circles-ii" size="lg" >}}

Music by William O. Smith. Choreography by Mary Stanton. A dance/sculpture film that explores new dimensions in color and space. The film develops like a fugue with dancers moving through themes that are repeated with variation and multiplication.



**Olga Spiegel, *Psychereel* (1978, color, sound, 12 min)**
