short_bio: Born in 1970, New York, where she currently lives and works. Ellen
  Altfest has developed her own distinct and devoted approach to a figurative
  and representational painting. Altfest always paints from life, drawn towards
  domestic plants, vegetables and more recently, male models. She immerses
  herself in an intense analysis and personal engagement with the subject that
  pushes her vision beyond the real. Altfest approaches her various subjects
  with a similar intent, spending hours of careful observation and study that
  results in images that although appear voyeuristic are portrayed with a
  deadpan humour and utmost vigilance towards her painting process.
