    event_bio: "Director of the NDN Collective’s LANDBACK Campaign, Krystal Two
      Bulls is Oglala Lakota and Northern Cheyenne from Lame Deer, Montana. She
      has extensive experience as an organizer and on the frontlines with
      campaign development and management on local, national and transnational
      campaigns for social, racial and environmental justice. Krystal’s identity
      as a Native American veteran is central to her organizing and
      storytelling. At the heart of Krystal’s work are the connections between
      collective wellness, environmental justice, Indigenous Peoples’ Rights,
      and anti-militarism. In healing from her experience as a soldier, Krystal
      has dedicated herself to embodying what she views as the essential quality
      of a warrior: a commitment to the well-being of not only her People and
      their relationship to the land, but that of all Peoples. "

Please join us for a conversation with the NDN Collective on the [Land Back campaign to reclaim the Black Hills](https://ndncollective.org/ndn-collective-calls-for-closure-of-mount-rushmore-and-for-the-black-hills-to-be-returned-to-the-lakota/)—the sacred Lakota lands on which Mount Rushmore is situated—and to return the land into the stewardship of the Indigenous nations who have historically called the Black Hills home.
