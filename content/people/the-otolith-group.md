short_bio: The Otolith Group was founded in 2002 by **Kodwo Eshun** and
  **Anjalika Sagar.** The group integrates film and video production with
  curating, programming, and writing.  For Eshun and Sagar the morphological
  figure of the otolith operates as a kind of Black box for withholding
  intention, gauging impact, measuring expectation and calculating discrepancy.
  Approaching curation as an artistic practice of building intergenerational and
  cross-cultural platforms, the collective has been influential in critically
  introducing particular works of a range of artists in the UK, US, Europe, and
  Lebanon. The Otolith Group currently has an exhibition at Galway Arts Centre
  (Ireland) and has had numerous solo exhibitions internationally.
