short_bio: "Visual artist and poet **Alice Attie**  received an MFA in Poetry
  under the tutelage of June Jordon, and completed a Ph.D. in Comparative
  literature. Attie's writing addresses the challenge within the meeting place
  of language and the unspeakable: how we accommodate loss, how we speak about
  what is inaccessible to language. The tenuous distinction between writing and
  drawing has always been a fascination for Attie. Alice Attie’s visual work has
  been shown in many collections including the Whitney Museum of American Art,
  the Museum of Modern Art, The Jewish Museum, The Getty, and The Museum of Fine
  Arts in Houston. Attie’s two previous books of poems, _These Figures Lining
  the Hills_ and _Under the Aleppo Sun_, were published by Seagull Books."
