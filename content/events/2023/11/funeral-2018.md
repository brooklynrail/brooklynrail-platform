*Funeral* is the third and final film in the MONOLOGUE Trilogy that Vandy Rattana produced between 2015 and 2019. Together with *Monologue* and *…far away, over there, the ocean*, *Funeral* continues to explore the possibility of reinterpreting the historical trauma and the method of transcendence of historical time through the landscape of Cambodia. 

*Funeral* reflects artists' unique perspective by telling the story of a family of two; Thun and Deoun, the children of the dead, and an elder herb planter. Deoun, a very young daughter, possesses the natural power that allows her to see the mysteries around her, whereas Thun, the brother, feels normal about everything around him. The herb planter (old lady), a thinker type, could only imagine a future of the arrival of evil; she can’t do anything as she presumes that life is the mythical gesture in front of the gigantic empty mirror where every soul must pass by. In this film, Vandy employs myths, fictional narratives, and philosophical thinking to reinterpret the cycle and destiny of civilization toward death and rebirth.
