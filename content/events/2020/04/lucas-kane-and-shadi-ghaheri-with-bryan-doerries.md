During his tenure at Theater of War Productions, the company has presented diverse projects across the United States and internationally.

Doerries’ books include *The Theater of War: What Ancient Greek Tragedies Can Teach Us Today*, *The Odyssey of Sergeant Jack Brennan*, and a collection of his translations of ancient Greek Tragedies entitled *All That You’ve Seen Here is God*. Among his awards, he has received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Kenyon College, and in March 2017, he was named Public Artist in Residence (PAIR) for the City of New York, a joint appointment with the New York City Department of Veterans’ Services and Department of Cultural Affairs.
