short_bio: "A founding figure in queer art history and responsible for the first
  queer scholarship on a number of artists beginning in the early 90's. Recent
  projects include a study of the international influence of Herbert Marcuseâ€™s
  writing on the visual arts, a new reading of the cultural wars in the era of
  AIDS, a project envisioning supplanting the predominantly binary understanding
  of sexuality with a trans perspective, and new work on queer Latinx artists in
  periods of dictatorship. His recent exhibition About Face: Stonewall, Revolt
  and New Queer Art, was the largest queer exhibition yet mounted. Katz has been
  a central figure in the establishment of the field of queer studies in the US.
  He also founded and chaired several non-profit, queer activist organizations.
