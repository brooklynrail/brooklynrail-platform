short_bio: Born 1971 in McAllen, Texas, and based in Brooklyn, NY, and upstate
  New York, **Clarity Haynes** is known for her long-standing explorations of
  the torso as a site for painted portraiture. Works in her _Breast/Chest
  Portrait Project,_ always painted from life and usually monumental in scale,
  have focused on themes of healing, trauma, and self-determination. Feminist
  and queer craft practices are often honored in her work. Bright colors, lively
  compositions and multiple narratives conjoin in the depictions of both bodies
  and altars. Her work has been exhibited widely, including at the Aldrich
  Contemporary Art Museum, New Discretions, the Smithsonianâ€™s National Portrait
  Gallery, and many others. Her work has been discussed in publications like
  _Hyperallergic_  and _Artnews,_ among others.
