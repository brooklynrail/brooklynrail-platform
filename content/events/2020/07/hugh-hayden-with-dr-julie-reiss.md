    event_bio: "Hugh Hayden transforms familiar materials to challenge our
      perceptions of ourselves, others, and the environment. Raised in Texas and
      trained as an architect, his work arises from a deep connection to nature
      and its organic materials. By transforming familiar objects to challenge
      human perception, Hayden investigates how we view ourselves and our
      surroundings. He utilizes wood as his primary medium, frequently loaded
      with multi-layered histories in their origin, including objects as varied
      as discarded trunks, rare indigenous timber, Christmas trees, or souvenir
      African sculptures. Haydenâ€™s work questions the stasis of social dynamics
      and asks the viewer to examine their place within an ever-shifting
      ecosystem. "
