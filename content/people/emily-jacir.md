short_bio: As poetic as it is political and biographical, **Emily Jacirâ€™s** work
  investigates histories of colonization, exchange, translation, transformation,
  resistance, and movement. Drawing on rituals such as dances, processions and
  games, the artist charts the way space, collectivity, and memories are
  claimed. She has been the recipient of many awards, most recently an honorary
  doctorate from NCAD in Dublin, Ireland; an American Academy of Arts and
  Letters prize (2023); the Andrew W. Mellon Rome Prize Fellowship at the
  American Academy in Rome (2015); and the Alpert Award (2011). She is the
  founder of Dar Yusuf Nasri Jacir for Art and Research in Bethlehem.
