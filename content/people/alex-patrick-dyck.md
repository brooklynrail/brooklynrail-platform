short_bio: "**Alex Patrick Dyck** is a multimedia poet, splosh artist, frog man,
  storyteller, performer & medicine maker; a romantic hoarder of sentimental
  trash and trampled roses, an altar builder, memory gatherer, a seeker seeking.
  They work with the interaction of plants, dye, resin, textiles, refuse,
  movement, bodily fluids, text & hardware as a way to explore the
  life-death-life cycle of the natural world. They see art-making as a
  devotional act before the divine, imbued with the interlocking arms of desire
  and grief. Alex is the April artist-in-residence at Basilica Hudson in
  conjunction with the Spark of Hudson. They live, work and grow in Hudson, New
  York on occupied Mohican land."
