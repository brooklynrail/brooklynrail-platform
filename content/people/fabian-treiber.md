short_bio: "**Fabian Treiber** layers up and applies fine glazes using highly
  pigmented acrylic inks and paste-like masses of paint. The works seem like
  representations of objects, landscapes or interiors, but the artist’s focus is
  less on the pure reproduction of reality and rather on recreating his memory
  thereof and the feeling thus induced—in other words, the transfer of feeling
  that lies beneath the surface. Treiber’s painting is concerned with a
  balancing and shifting of the demarcation line that seems to determine our
  perception and feeling while at the same time always showing us we are dealing
  with a painted and thus distinct reality."
