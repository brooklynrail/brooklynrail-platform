short_bio: "**Amy Sillman** has lived and worked in NYC since the mid-1970s. She
  is best known for her rigorous formal engagement with painting and iterative
  drawings, and an excavation of form that lies between abstraction and
  figuration. Over the decades of her practice, Sillman has developed a rich,
  open-ended exploration of how painting might work in relation to diverse media
  and, in particular, questions of time and sequence. She has experimented with
  embedding painting with such forms as animations, digital printmaking,
  large-scale drawing installations, and zines. Sillman's work has been
  exhibited widely in the USA and Europe, and her works are in many private and
  public collections. Her collection of art writing, _Faux Pas_, is in its third
  reprint since its initial publication in 2020."
