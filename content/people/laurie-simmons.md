short_bio: "**Laurie Simmons** was born on Long Island, New York, in 1949. She
  received a BFA from the Tyler School of Art, Philadelphia (1971). Simmons
  stages photographs and films with paper dolls, finger puppets, ventriloquist
  dummies, and costumed dancers as “living objects,” animating a dollhouse world
  suffused with nostalgia and colored by an adult’s memories, longings, and
  regrets. Mining childhood memories and media constructions of gender roles,
  her photographs are charged with an eerie, dreamlike quality. She has received
  many awards and fellowships, and has had major exhibitions at the Museum of
  Modern Art, New York (2006); Baltimore Museum of Art (1997); and elsewhere.
  Simmons lives and works in New York."
