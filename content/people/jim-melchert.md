short_bio: "**Jim Melchert** (1930-2023) was one of the leading figures in the
  San Francisco Bay Area artistic community, noted for his openness to
  experimentation and his encouragement of that of others. While championing the
  new, with particular emphasis on conceptualism and clay, he also set standards
  of integrity and grace among artists. Melchert received degrees from Princeton
  and the University of California, Berkely, where he studied ceramics with
  Peter Voulkos. He taught at the San Francisco Art Institute and then at UC
  Berkeley. He was director of the Visual Arts Program of the National Endowment
  for the Arts from 1977 until 1981 and of the American Academy in Rome from
  1984 until 1988."
