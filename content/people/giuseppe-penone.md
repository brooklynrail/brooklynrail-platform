short_bio: Born in Garessio, Italy in 1947, Giuseppe Penone is one of the most
  significant artists related to developments in sculpture in the 60s and 70s
  and to Arte Povera. Penone’s work retains its own distinctive character
  incorporating binary meanings related to the natural world and the notion of
  living sculpture. Penone’s interest in the space between the hand and the
  touched surface that becomes sculpture and drawing, between imprint and sight,
  gesture and action, has been sustained throughout his body of work. He has
  exhibited extensively and internationally, and recently received the McKim
  Medal (2017) and the prestigious Praemium Imperiale International Arts Award
  for Sculpture in 2014. His exhibition at Marian Goodman is on view through
  April 17, 2021.
