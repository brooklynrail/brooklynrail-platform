short_bio: "**Sumayya Vally** is Principal of the award-winning architecture and
  research, Counterspace. Vally’s design, research and pedagogical practice is
  searching for expression for hybrid identities and territory, particularly for
  African and Islamic conditions—both rooted and diasporic. Her process is often
  forensic and draws on the oral, aural, sound, ritual, supernatural, and the
  overlooked as generative places of history and work. In 2022, Vally was
  selected by the World Economic Forum to be one of its Young Global Leaders,
  and, as a TIME100 Next list honoree, has been identified as someone who will
  shape the future of architectural practice and canon. In April 2022, Vally was
  appointed to the curatorial team for the first  Islamic Arts Biennale. "
