    event_bio: "Over the past decade, Raha Raissnia's paintings, drawings, and films
      have unfolded within a permutational, self- reflexive structure. In her
      earlier work, the artist presented dense, architectonic black and white
      drawings and paintings that appeared to echo a certain postwar European
      abstraction. Rather than deferring to gesture, however, Raissnia
      orchestrated these scapes by steadily tracing a configuration of
      intersecting and overlapping vectors in space. In her self-titled
      exhibition at the gallery in 2009, a hybrid 16mm film and 35mm slide
      projection occupying one wall provided a glimpse into the expanded cinema
      practice that informs the artist’s two-dimensional work. The artist’s
      films, drawings, and paintings are closely imbricated: paintings are
      contrapuntal compositions catalyzed by film stills, transferred faintly
      onto the surface of the panel and elaborated upon with oil and gesso. Her
      films echo this archaeological process, constructed from fragments of
      earlier work and structured as overlapping pairs of 35mm slide and 16mm
      film projections. Raissnia’s drawings and collages, likewise comprised of
      image transfers, with Sumi ink and compressed charcoal, examine this
      relationship of mutual influence. All are guided by the materiality of
      their media."

![page1image451141872](blob:https://brooklynrail.netlify.app/99e81ae4-484a-4aa2-87b8-10bc2e19d625)*[To Jonas with Love](https://www.kismithgallery.com)* ([Ki Smith Gallery](https://www.kismithgallery.com)) *is* a multimedia exhibition honoring Jonas Mekas curated by Chuck Smith and Benn Northover. For over sixty years, from his earliest days living on Orchard Street in the 1950s until his passing in 2019, Lithuanian filmmaker, poet, and artist Jonas Mekas was a cultural icon of Downtown NYC and a passionate guardian of artistic freedom. As he wandered through- out the city with his ever-present camera, Jonas always sought glimpses of beauty and poetry amid the bustle of the streets.

Through his work and activism he stood as a guiding light for generations of artists and filmmakers. Along the way, he founded Film Culture magazine, the Filmmakers Co-op and Cinematheque, Anthology Film Archives, and the now-legendary Movie Journal col- umn in The Village Voice. This month, Jonas’s friends come together to celebrate the joy and inspiration that Jonas evoked and to remember his vibrant and undying poetic spirit. This exhibition features an eclectic mix of artists and filmmakers whose works either em- body or directly respond to Jonas’s tireless creativity and self-expression. To Jonas with Love will include a traditional gallery installation of photography, painting, drawing, and sculpture at the new Ki Smith Gallery East Village (197 East 4th Street) as well as a film and video installation with projections and monitors at the Gallery’s annex (181 Mott Street).
