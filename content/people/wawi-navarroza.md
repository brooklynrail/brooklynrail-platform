short_bio: "**Wawi Navarroza** is a renowned Filipina lens-based artist known
  for her large format photographic tableaus and self-portraits. Informed by
  post-colonial dialogue and globalization, Navarroza employs her corporeal form
  as an artistic medium. Her in-studio collages serve as a testament to the
  various facets and stages of the women's narrative, portraying woman as
  creator. She is the recipient of the Asian Cultural Council Fellowship Grant
  New York and Lucas Artists Fellowship Award for Visual Arts San Francisco. Her
  work has been exhibited in museums internationally, and in galleries in
  Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Laos, Cambodia, London, Spain, and
  Italy."
