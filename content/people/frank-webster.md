short_bio: "**Frank Webster** is award-winning landscape painter who has
  exhibited nationally and internationally for over 20 years. In June of 2022,
  he was awarded a berth on the spring expedition of the Arctic Circle
  Residency, sailing the waters of the Svalbard Archipelago in a tall-masted
  Barquentine a mere 150 leagues from the North Pole. During the voyage he
  documented the region in plein air paintings with special attention paid to
  the majestic glaciers of this unique and fragile ecosystem. Later in the same
  year he was an artist in residence at the Burren College of Art where he
  trekked over and recorded the distinctive glaciated karst landscape on the
  west coast of Ireland. He currently teaches watercolor at the Art Students
  League of New York."
