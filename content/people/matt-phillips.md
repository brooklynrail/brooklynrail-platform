short_bio: "**Matt Phillips** is a painter living in Brooklyn, NY. Recent
  exhibitions include _Hold Tight Horizon Eyes_, on view at Anna Zorina Gallery
  (NYC) through January 13, 2024 . Phillipsâ€™ works often employ fundamental
  elements of painting: simple shapes, modulated values and color relationships.
  These rather rudimentary components are combined and remixed to produce
  unexpected outcomes. Color, shape, mark and form engage one another in both
  strange and familiar ways, becoming tense, humorous, quirky and ultimately
  meaningful. He is represented by The Landing Gallery (LA) and Mindy Solomon
  Gallery (Miami). "
