short_bio: Video and installation artist **Shirin Neshat** explores the
  political and social conditions of Iranian and Muslim life in her works,
  particularly focusing on women and feminist issues. Neshat was born in Qazvin,
  Iran, and left the country to study art in the US at 17; she graduated from
  the UC Berkeley in 1982. When she returned to her home in 1990, she found it
  barely recognizable from before the 1979 Revolution, a shocking experience
  that incited the meditations on memory, loss, and contemporary life in Iran
  that are central to her work. Her Women of Allah series introduced the
  hallmark themes of her pieces through which she examines conditions of male,
  female, public, private, religious, political, and secular identities in both
  Iranian and Western cultures.
