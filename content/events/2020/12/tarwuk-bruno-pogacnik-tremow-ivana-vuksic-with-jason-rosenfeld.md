    event_bio: TARWUK (Bruno Pogacnik Tremow & Ivana Vukšic) are a collaborative duo
      from Croatia who have been working together since 2014. They make
      sculptures and installations that conjure unknown rituals and traumatic
      scenes of war and devastation. They use a range of materials—wax, rope,
      pigments, wood, plaster—to evoke the feeling of having just stumbled on a
      story whose totality will never be told. Their installations invite
      projection and prediction, allowing the viewer to imagine their own
      narratives. Their works challenge assumptions by imposing personal,
      speculative stories that create a complex and generative system of
      meaning, materializing their personal histories into objects. For Tremow
      and Vukšic, “work and life… are one.” Their work reflects their
      upbringing, first in socialist Yugoslavia and later in post-socialist
      Croatia. They were raised in a war zone, with our families and our houses
      being torn apart. They seek to challenge the mechanisms and assumptions of
      society by imposing intensely personal speculative fabulations as possible
      alternatives.
