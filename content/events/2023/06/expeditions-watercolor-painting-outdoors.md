During this workshop we will paint outdoors in Central Park with an emphasis on plein-air watercolor painting. Painting will be used as a tool to explore the natural environment in an urban setting. Our concentration will be on observing nature and developing a strong sense of fluidity and light. Working directly from the landscape, you will be encouraged to work simply and accurately in your painting. All levels are welcome.
