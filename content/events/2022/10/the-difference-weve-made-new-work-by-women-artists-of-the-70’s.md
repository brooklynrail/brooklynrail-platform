The Difference We’ve Made highlights the work of Dotty Attie, Nancy Azara, Josely Carvalho, Maureen Connor, Betsy Damon, Carol Goebel, Janet Goldner, Susan Grabel, Carol Hamoy, Janet Olivia Henry, Lucy Hodgson, Joyce Kozloff, Cynthia Mailman, Carol Massa, Dindga McCannon, Juanita McNeely, Kazuko Miyamoto, Vernita Nemec, Senga Nengudi, Susan Schwalb, Dee Shapiro, Jenny Tango, and Sharon Wybrants. Their work represents the diversity of creative expression with mediums ranging from installation, painting, sculpture, performance, and more. Through their compelling works these talented, feminist, trailblazing artists cleared paths for generations of women. This exhibition illustrates their perseverance in their ongoing creative practice to this day. Marlena Vaccaro, Director and Curator of Carter Burden Gallery, states, “The Carter Burden Gallery opened in Chelsea in 2009 to meet a need of representation of older professional artists. It is the first of its kind in the nation, exclusively featuring the vibrant and significant works of professional artists over the age of sixty. The women exhibited in this show are the shoulders subsequent women artists have stood and continue to stand on.

It is no secret that older professional artists are often under-recognized by the arts sector and given few opportunities to show and sell their work due to perceived limited marketability and other ageism related factors. This can be especially true of women artists. This dually hinders economic opportunity for older artists, while limiting public access to unique artistic perspectives. The Carter Burden Gallery celebrates this community’s unique contribution and particularly the immense and enduring influence of the pioneering artists in this show. As Maya Angelou said, ‘I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.’ The outstanding artists in this show made future generations of women artists feel they could do it, feel they could be part of the important work being done, and know they would be leaders in the conversations that would shape the art world.”
