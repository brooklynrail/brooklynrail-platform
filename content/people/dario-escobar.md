short_bio: "Conceptual artist **Dario Escobar’s** large-scale installations made
  from sports equipment are not purely about play: Escobar uses these popular
  recreational objects to look at Guatamala’s history and culture in a global
  context. In this vein, Escobar’s work famously uses common and mass-produced
  materials (like motor oil, bicycle tires, or soccer balls) in conjunction with
  traditional Guatemalan artisanal techniques and mythological references.
  Escobar modifies and shapes these found objects and artifacts of material
  culture into abstract forms that belong to two time periods simultaneously, as
  in his “Quetzalcoatl” pieces (2003) that turned steel and vulcanized rubber
  into primordial biomorphic forms."
