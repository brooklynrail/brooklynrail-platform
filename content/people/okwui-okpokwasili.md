short_bio: "Brooklyn based performing artist **Okwui Okpokwasili** works at the
  intersection of theater, dance, and installation. Her work considers the
  dynamics of interiority and psychic space in shaping relationships, sociality,
  and memory grounded in the body and perspective of the Afro-femme. In
  partnership with collaborator Peter Born, Okpokwasili creates
  multidisciplinary projects. They include \"Bessie\" Award winning _Pent-Up: A
  Revenge Dance_, \"Bessie\" Award winning _Bronx Gothic_, _Bronx Gothic: The
  Oval_, _Poor People's TV Room_, _Poor People's TV Room Solo_, _When I Return
  Who Will Receive Me_, and _Adaku's Revolt_. They recently had a work installed
  as part of the exhibition: _Grief and Grievance, Art and Mourning in America_
  at the New Museum."
