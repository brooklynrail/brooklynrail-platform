short_bio: Born in 1985 in Paris, France, **Prune Nourry** is a
  multi-disciplinary New York-based artist who draws her inspiration from the
  issues of human selection. With a degree in wood sculpture from Ecole Boulle
  in Paris, Nourry explores bioethics through sculpture as well as video,
  photography, and performance. Nourished by in-depth research in science and
  sociology, and largely influenced by anthropology, she has created a triptych
  focusing on gender preference, starting with _Holy Daughters_ in India in
  2009. Her latest project, _Terracotta Daughters_ is the last part of the
  triptych and has done a World Tour starting in Shanghai, heading to Paris,
  Zurich, New York and Mexico. It is now back in Shanghai and will be buried in
  China until 2030.
