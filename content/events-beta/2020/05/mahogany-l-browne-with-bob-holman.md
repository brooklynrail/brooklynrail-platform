She is also the founder of the Woke Baby Book Fair (a nationwide diversity literature campaign) & as an Arts for Justice grantee, is completing her first book of essays on mass incarceration, investigating its impact on women and children. She lives in Brooklyn, NY.

**Bob Holman** is an American poet and poetry activist, most closely identified with the oral tradition, the spoken word, and poetry slam. As a promoter of poetry in many media, Holman has spent the last four decades working variously as an author, editor, publisher, performer, emcee of live events, director of theatrical productions, producer of films and television programs, record label executive, university professor, and archivist. He was described by Henry Louis Gates Jr. in *The New Yorker* as "the postmodern promoter who has done more to bring poetry to cafes and bars than anyone since Ferlinghetti."

Bob is a contributor of the *Brooklyn Rail*. His two new books, *The Unspoken* and *Life Poem*, were written 50 years apart. You can order them from YBK Publishers.
