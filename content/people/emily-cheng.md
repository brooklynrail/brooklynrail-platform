short_bio: "**Emily Cheng** is a painter born in NYC where she works and lives.
  Her large scale symmetrical abstractions draw on reference imagery from
  throughout history, such as 15th century European ornament, Chinese
  landscapes, or Zhou Dynasty Goddesses, and are imbued with an overwhelming
  hypnotic quality. She has had six solo shows in Asia, currently in the
  Shanghai Biennale and upcoming shows at Hanart TZ Gallery in HK, Art Basel and
  Taipei Dangdai spring/2024. Her awards include the National Endowment for the
  Arts, NYSCA grant and a Pollock Krasner Foundation Fellowship. She taught
  Asian Art History for 23 years at the School of Visual Arts, NY."
