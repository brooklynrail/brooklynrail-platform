  a gallerist and publisher since he began his career in 1971 at Galerie Beyeler
  in Basel, Switzerland. In 1980, after moving to New York, he founded Peter
  Blum Edition, where he was among the first print publishers to work with a new
  generation of European and American artists. In 1984, Blum co-founded
  _PARKETT_ magazine, working directly with international artists and critics to
  create an engaging forum for contemporary art. In 1993 Peter opened his first
  gallery space in SoHo and has since had spaces in Chelsea, 57th Street, and
