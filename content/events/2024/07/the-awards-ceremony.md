Join us in person on Wednesday, July 24, at 5:30 p.m. for a conversation on golf and painting featuring artist and golf aficionado Beto De Volder and Alejandra Seeber. Then, during the awards ceremony, two ceramic trophies created by Seeber will be announced: one to the winner of a lucky draw during the event and the other to the best mini-golf score of the whole exhibition.
