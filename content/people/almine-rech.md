short_bio: "**Almine Rech** opened a gallery with an associate in the Marais in
  Paris in November 1989. Five years later, Almine Rech opened her own gallery
  in a new space in Paris. Almine Rech now has galleries in major cities
  including Brussels, London, New York, and Shanghai. The gallery’s programming
  is not tied to one formal aspect or to a specific medium, but to the
  singularity of the artwork and the artistic commitment of the artist. Almine
  Rech believes that art is a space for freedom of expression, perhaps the only
  such space in contemporary society. In addition to its roster of
  internationally recognized artists, it has always been the gallery’s mission
  to continually seek out and add artists to its program. "
