short_bio: "**Thomas J Price** has rapidly become one of the most important
  British contemporary artists of his generation, subverting stereotypical
  representations of figures we value in society and traditional power
  structures. Price has exhibited widely in the UK and internationally. In 2021,
  Price was commissioned by Hackney Council to create the first permanent public
  sculptures to celebrate the contribution of the Windrush generation and their
  descendants in the UK, unveiled in June 2022. Price has major forthcoming
  institutional projects in 2023 with the V&A Museum, London, UK and The
  National Portrait Gallery, London, UK, alongside a solo presentation at
  Rotterdam’s historic central station and ‘Art In The Park’ at Baur au Lac,
  Zurich."
