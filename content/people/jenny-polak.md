short_bio: "**Jenny Polak** makes site and community responsive art that
  amplifies demands for social justice. Originally from England, Polak makes art
  that draws on her background in architecture and includes public and socially
  engaged projects such as architectural installations, drawings and useful
  commemorative objects. Polak's family history of migration drives her to
  examine detention centers, the violence of borders and strategies for
  surviving hostile authorities. Polak's fictional firm Design For The Alien
  Within creates hypothetical hiding and dwelling places, symbolic lookout and
  counter-surveillance structures. Polak's work has been exhibited widely across
  the world, and she has been the recipient of numerous fellowships and awards.
