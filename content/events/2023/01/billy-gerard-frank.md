League Talks begins its 2023 season with a lecture from League alum and acclaimed artist Billy Gerard Frank. Frank’s lecture will address his interdisciplinary art practice, which approaches themes of global and cross-cultural exchange through a range of forms. In Frank’s body of work, which most recently includes representing Grenada at the 2019 and 2022 Venice Biennales, film becomes essay, portrait becomes theater, and biography becomes art installation. As Frank explores and combines a vast range of media, he creates multifaceted works that offer vital new readings on historical narratives. Join Frank as he unpacks his recent work and lends his perspective as artist and educator, in this talk delivered at one of his earliest art schools.
