short_bio: "**Marcel Alcalá** received their BFA from the School of the Art
  Institute of Chicago. They have held solo exhibitions at Night Gallery, Mickey
  Gallery, and Deli Gallery and exhibited in numerous institutions, including
  the Tom of Finland Foundation (where they were artist-in-residence) and MCA
  Chicago. Their work was recently featured in  _Made in L.A. 2023: Acts of
  Living_, Hammer Museum and  _Moved\\Displaced_, Orange County Center for
  Contemporary Art. Alcalá is also a performer and writer. Assuming a derisive
  alter ego named Payasa (the feminine form of the Spanish word for clown),
  their performance work often tackles topics that feel otherwise
  taboo—specifically, the artist’s thoughts about race and gender politics and
  their personal experiences with these constructs."
