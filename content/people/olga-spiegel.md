short_bio: "Artist **Olga Spiegel** was born in France while her family was in
  hiding after fleeing Belgium during the war. She moved to New York City in
  1964. Nurtured by psychedelic art, surrealism and science fiction, Spiegel has
  created a unique visual language where she can present, in her words, “…spaces
  of wonder that point to ever changing notions of the Universe and our sense of
  Being….” Spiegel studied briefly at the Académie Royale des Beaux Arts in
  Brussels before enrolling at Saint Martin’s School of Art in London from 1962
  to 1964. Her work has been exhibited widely, most recently in the New
  York-based group shows _Field Trip: Psychedelic Solution, 1986-1995_  at the
  Outsider Art Fair and _Psychedelic Landscape_ at Eric Firestone Gallery."
