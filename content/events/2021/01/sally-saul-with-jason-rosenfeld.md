      Sally Saul earned a BA from the University of Colorado in Boulder, CO and
      an MA in American Literature from the San Francisco State University,
      where she graduated in 1973. During her time in California, she became
      acquainted with the Bay Area visual arts movement, characterized by a
      penchant for bright colors and an interest in drawing subject matter from
      day-to- day life. 


      In the early 1980s Saul relocated to Austin where she enrolled in ceramics courses at the University of Texas, and began to formalize her process. Informed by memory, her sculptures came to explore complexities of the human condition. In recent years Saul has achieved significant milestones in her career. Her first survey exhibition Blue Hills, Yellow Tree, opened in May 2019 at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, NY. The exhibition brought together works from over three decades, representing her years spent in San Francisco, Austin, TX, and beyond. Saul presented a solo show at Almine Rech, Paris in January 2020. She has also participated in exhibitions at venues including Jeffrey Deitch, New York, NY; the Art Museum of West Virginia, Morgantown, WV; the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Ridgefield, CT; White Columns, New York, NY; and Lumber Room, Portland, OR; among many others. In 2018, the artist, with Peter Saul, co-curated the exhibition Out of Control at Venus Over Manhattan, New York, NY. Saul lives and works in Germantown, New York.
