short_bio: "Daniel Bouchard's most recent books are Spider Drop (Subpress) and
  Art & Nature (Ugly Duckling Presse). Peter Gizzi said of his work: \"There's a
  love of diction, of words and their histories, of things, and things as words;
  a highly crafted and hammered work artfully deployed.\" His poems in progress
  examine received history and scrutinize it as manifested in painting, poetry,
  film, music, and monuments. He is a long distance walker and an amateur book
  restorer. He curates The Liminal Reading Series in Cambridge, Mass. and works
  in academic publishing."
