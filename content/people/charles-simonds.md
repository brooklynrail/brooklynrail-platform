short_bio: "Since 1970 **Charles Simonds** has made dwelling places for an
  imaginary civilization of Little People who are migrating through the streets
  of cities throughout the world. He has worked with immigrant communities,
  patients in mental hospitals, refugee children and at a rural school in
  Southern India. His work concerns how we live and how we understand our built
  environment as an expression of beliefs about nature, the past, present and
  future. He served on the Board of the Lower East Side Coalition for Human
  Housing as a community advocate in the 1970â€™s. "
