short_bio: "Exhibiting professionally since the 1980s, **Deborah Buck** has
  shown recently in The Hamptons, Connecticut, and New York City. She explores
  the interplay of surrealism and abstraction in her work, where interests in
  absurdity, romanticism, and the darker side of fairy tales lend a strong
  narrative sense to her practice. Deborah has played an instrumental part in
  New Yorkâ€™s arts education as both member of the faculty at School of Visual
  Arts Master of Design Program and as a Trustee of The Pratt Institute. She is
  the Founder and Director of The Deborah Buck Foundation which supports
  organizations working to reverse the marginalization of women in the fine
  arts. "
