short_bio: After finishing school, in 1985 **Anton Kern** began his career at
  Lempertz Auction House in Cologne. In 1991, Kern left Germany for New York to
  work at MoMA's Print Department, and after two and a half years, he left the
  museum to become a Director at Barbara Gladstone Gallery, where he remained
  until 1995. In 1996, Kern opened his eponymous gallery with the goal of
  exhibiting the work of young and emerging artists – many of which he still
  works with today – while bringing their work to the attention of a large
  audience as well as collectors and museums.
