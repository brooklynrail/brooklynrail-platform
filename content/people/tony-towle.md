short_bio: "**Tony Towle** was born in New York in 1939; he began writing poetry
  in 1960 “out of the blue.” His connection to the New York School dates from
  1963, when he took workshops at the New School with Kenneth Koch and Frank
  O’Hara. Since then, he has published thirteen books of poetry, most recently
  _Noir_ (from Hanging Loose Press, 2017). His latest publication, _My First
  Three Books_ (from Vehicle Editions, 2020), combines an interview,
  photographs, and a CD of the poet reading some of his early work. Awards
  include fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Foundation
  for Contemporary Art, the Ingram Merrill Foundation, and the Frank O’Hara
  Award."
