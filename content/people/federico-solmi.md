short_bio: "(Italy, 1973) lives and works in New York. Solmiâ€™s work utilizes
  bright colors and a satirical aesthetic to portray a dystopian vision  of our
  present-day society His exhibitions often feature articulate installations
  composed  of a variety of media including video, painting, drawing, and
  sculpture. Solmi uses his art as a vehicle to stimulate a visceral
  conversation with his audience, highlighting the  contradictions and
  fallibility that characterize our time. Through his work, Solmi examines
  unconscious human impulses and desires in order to critique Western society's
  obsession with individual success and display contemporary relationships
  between  nationalism, colonialism, religion, consumerism. "
