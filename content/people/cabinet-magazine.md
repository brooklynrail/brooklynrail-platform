first_name: Cabinet magazine
short_bio: Founded in New York as a non-profit in 2000, **_Cabinet_** is a
  magazine that uses an expansive definition of culture in order to stage
  productive encounters—and, at times, collisions—between modes of inquiry that
  are typically sequestered from one another. Its heraldic shield, featuring a
  fox and a hedgehog looking at one other, borrows its motif from a pre-Socratic
  fragment that describes the fox as knowing many small things, and the hedgehog
  one large thing. The magazine aims to be a home for both animals, one where
  non-systematic knowledge (found, for example, in some artistic practices) and
  highly disciplined knowledge (found, for example, in academic research) can
  rub against, disarm, and invigorate one another.
