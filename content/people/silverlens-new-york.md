  Manila and New York, aiming to place its artists within the broader framework
  of the contemporary art dialogue. Its continuing efforts to transcend borders
  across art communities in Asia have earned it recognition as one of the
  leading contemporary art galleries in Southeast Asia. Silverlens was founded
  in Manila by Isa Lorenzo in 2004, and in 2007 she was joined by co-director
  Rachel Rillo. In September 2022, the gallery opened its doors in the Chelsea
  neighborhood of New York, broadening its international scope and bringing its
