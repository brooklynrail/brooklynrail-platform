short_bio: "**Francesco Clemente** is a contemporary Italian artist known for
  his dreamlike paintings based on esoteric themes of sexuality and
  spirituality. He studied architecture at the University of Rome in 1970 before
  moving to India three years later. While abroad, he collaborated with local
  craftsman and painters, while also studying Hindu spiritual texts. His
  experience in traditional papermaking and miniature painting has had a lasting
  impact on his work. Relocating to New York in 1981, Clemente began
  collaborating with Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol, and Allen Ginsberg.
  Clemente lives and works in New York. The artistâ€™s works are held in the
  collections of The MoMA, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Tate Gallery in
  London, and others."
