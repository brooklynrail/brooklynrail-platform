Please join us for our ninth installment of Common Ground, when we will be joined by artists **Hank Willis Thomas** and **Paula Crown** in conversation with **Paul D. Miller** aka **DJ Spooky** for a discussion on [For Freedoms](https://forfreedoms.org/)' **2020 Awakening**, a campaign to increase voter engagement through a reimagining of the 1860 Wide Awakes movement—which swept through our nation's streets and welcomed Abraham Lincoln into the presidential office—for the 2020 Presidential Election. They will address the vital question: What does it mean to show up to the movement—or show up to the future—with our full selves?

This conversation will be moderated by **Malvika Jolly**, and will close with a poetry reading by feminist avant-garde writer **Rachel Levitsky**. 

### **About this series**

At the start of quarantine, the *Brooklyn Rail* asked how might we stay connected to each other in a time of self-isolation? Now we ask: How can we stay involved and engaged in upholding our civic responsibility to one another across communities? How can we deploy this community built through the New Social Environment—through hundreds of conversations and meals shared over the past six months—to mobilize daily action for grassroots movements, social justice and equity projects, and for the political good of our most marginalized communities across the nation? Tune in Thursdays at 1pm for Common Ground, a new lunchtime series featuring weekly conversations with social justice practitioners, changemakers, and activists on how we can mobilize our daily actions to radically reimagine our democracy.
