first_name: Andrea
last_name: Geyer
short_bio: "**Andrea Geyer** is a multi-disciplinary artist engaging queer
  methodologies in un-sensing the construction and politics of time. Her
  lens-based works activate the lingering potential of specific events, places,
  or biographies to materialize the entanglement of presence and absence due to
  ideologically motivated omissions in archives and memories. Exhibitions
  include: MoMA, the Whitney Museum of American Art; IMMA in Dublin; TATE Modern
  in London; Generali Foundation, Secession in Vienna; Witte De White in
  Rotterdam; Sao Paulo Biennal and documenta12/ Kassel. Forthcoming in 2024
  Gropiusbau, Berlin and Leslie Lohman Museum, New York. She is a 2023
  Guggenheim Fellow and the Associate Professor of New Genres at Parsons Fine
  Arts. "
