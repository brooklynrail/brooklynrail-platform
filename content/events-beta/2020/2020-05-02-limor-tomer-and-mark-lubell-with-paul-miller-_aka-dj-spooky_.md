As General Manager, Live Arts, she curates, commissions, produces, and presents groundbreaking performances, both in the Museum’s 700-seat auditorium and its galleries and public spaces.

**Mark Lubell** joined the International Center of Photography as executive director in November 2013. He was previously director of Magnum Photos (2004– 2011). He spearheaded the restructuring of Magnum, whose history is closely tied with the foundation of ICP, steering it into the 21st century and introducing new revenue streams in tune with today’s online marketplace. In 2007, American Photo named Lubell “Innovator of the Year” for his pioneering approach to multimedia and online communities. Beginning in 2008, he led "Access to Life," a project in which eight Magnum photographers documented the work of The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. It has successfully raised $1 billion to provide anti-retroviral medicines for HIV-positive people around the world. Prior to his work at Magnum, Lubell was chief operating officer of "Here is New York: A Democracy of Photographs," which was formed in the aftermath of the events of September 11, 2001. He was also a founding principal of software company Visual Edge Systems, Inc. [Photo credit: Henry Leutwyler]
