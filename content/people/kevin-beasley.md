short_bio: "**Kevin Beasley** (b. 1985, Lynchburg, VA) lives and works in New
  York. He received his BFA from The College for Creative Studies, Detroit in
  2007 and his MFA from Yale University School of Art, New Haven, CT in 2012.
  Beasley’s practice spans sculpture, photography, sound, and performance, while
  centering on materials of cultural and personal significance, from raw cotton
  harvested from his family’s property in Virginia to sounds gathered using
  contact microphones. Beasley alters, casts, and molds these diverse materials
  to form a body of works that acknowledge the complex, shared histories of the
  broader American experience, steeped in generational memories. "
