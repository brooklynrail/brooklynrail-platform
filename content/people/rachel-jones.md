short_bio: "**Rachel Jones** is a British artist who works primarily in
  painting, installation, sound, and performance. Jones explores a sense of self
  as a visual, visceral experience.The figures in her work are notably
  abstracted and Jones uses bold color, competing forms, and an interplay of
  textures to communicate her ideas to viewers, who bring their own experiences
  and cultural backgrounds to the interpretation of her works. This sense of
  community and shared history comes to the fore in her installations and
  performances, in which imagery, sound, and music coalesce in a celebration of
  Black culture. Jonesâ€™s work has been exhibited at institutions such as the
  Long Museum Shanghai and Chisenhale Gallery, London. She lives and works in
  London."
