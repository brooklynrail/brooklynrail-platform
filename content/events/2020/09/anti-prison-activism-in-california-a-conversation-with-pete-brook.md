    event_bio: Pete Brook is a writer, curator and educator focused on prisons,
      photos, and power. In 2008, he founded the website Prison Photography to
      bring together research and writing that unpacks issues of procedure,
      visibility, distribution and art in imagery as it emerges from the U.S.
      prison system.  Pete has curated multiple exhibitions, including Prison
      Obscura (2014–2016) that brought together images about mass incarceration
      that were created outside of the documentary tradition.  Pete’s writing
      has been published by Aperture, The Atlantic, ICP, The Marshall Project,
      Time, Truthout, Wired and others. In 2018, Pete was awarded the W. Eugene
      Smith Fund’s Howard Chapnick Award and a grant from the Pulitzer Center
      for Crisis Reporting for his work teaching history of photography in San
      Quentin State Prison. Pete teaches at California State University,
      Sacramento.

      James King is the State Campaigner for the Ella Baker Center for Human
      Rights. Prior to joining the organization, James worked to build
      recognition of the value of people who are being held in carceral spaces.
      In 2016, he organized a symposium at San Quentin, where he and other
      incarcerated students made specific policy recommendations concerning the
      implementation of Prop 57. In attendance were the Secretary of the
      California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, various officials
      from the California Governor’s office, numerous social justice advocates,
      and many of his incarcerated peers.


      James is also a writer and organizer, having written numerous op-eds, and a weekly blog that gave a first person perspective of the true impact of mass criminalization and living within the prison industrial complex. As an organizer, he founded a think tank of incarcerated people who were passionate about criminal justice policy and built relationships with multiple California criminal justice reform organizations.

      As a socially-engaged artist, Gregory Sale brings together often opposed
      constituencies of the criminal justice system. His aim is to soften and
      collapse boundaries, thereby encouraging reciprocal dialogue and mutual
      learning. A somewhat quieter but no less political component of his work
      flirts with the fluid parameters of public and private love. Sale is now
      collaborating with individuals who have conviction histories on a series
      of projects that focus on changing the narrative of reentry. Rap Sheet to
      Resume (2015-16) was created with the Urban Justice Center in New York. As
      an embedded artist with the Anti-Recidivism Coalition, and in partnership
      with National Parks Service and Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, he
      is currently developing Future IDs at Alcatraz (2018-19) for the iconic
      prison turned National Park in San Francisco Bay.


      His work has received support from Creative Capital Foundation, Art Matters, SPArt (Social Practice Art), A Blade of Grass/David Rockefeller Fund, and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. He has been awarded prestigious artist residency at Headlands, Montalvo, Yaddo, MacDowell Colony, Ucross, and Centre d'Art Marnay. Based in Phoenix and in Los Angeles, Sale is Associate Professor of Intermedia and Public Practice at School of Art at Arizona State University.

At the start of quarantine, the *Brooklyn Rail* asked how might we stay connected to each other in a time of self-isolation? Now we ask: How can we stay involved and engaged in upholding our civic responsibility to one another across communities? How can we deploy this community built through the *New Social Environment*—through hundreds of conversations and meals shared over the past six months—to mobilize daily action for grassroots movements, social justice and equity projects, and for the political good of our most marginalized communities across the nation? Tune in Thursdays at 1pm for *Common Ground*, a new lunchtime series featuring weekly conversations with social justice practitioners, changemakers, and activists on how we can mobilize our daily actions to radically reimagine our democracy.

Please join us for our fourth installment of *Common Ground* featuring **James King**, State Campaigner for the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, and **Emiliano Lopez** and **Gregory Sale**, collaborators behind *[Future IDs at Alcatraz](https://futureids.com/)*, an ongoing exhibition which uses ID-inspired artworks by a team of collaborators in the carceral system to translate the demand for criminal justice reform into stark visual language, to radically reframe the narrative of reentry, and to offer the possibility of alternative futures. They will be in conversation with **Pete Brook**, writer and social justice curator behind *[Prison Photography](https://prisonphotography.org/),* for a discussion on the urgent campaigns, successful strategies, and ongoing fights to which grassroots organizers in the Golden State are committed.

We will close with a reading by poet **Mona Kareem.**
