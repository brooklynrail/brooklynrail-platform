last_name: Hart
short_bio: "Through her interdisciplinary practice **Heather Hart** fuses
  fabricated and historical belief systems; legends that have been bequeathed
  through generations mixed with invention and intuition. She is captivated by
  the slippage, the liminal space, between truth and fiction, oral and written
  histories; between what one says and what the other hears. Hart is interested
  in the communication between the public and the artist, the public and the
  work, and public with each other in a space. She is interested in cognition as
  it intersects with the built environment, historical records and the Black
  fantastic. Hart co-founded the nonprofit Black Lunch Table, most recently was
  a Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard, and is an
  Assistant Professor at Rutgers University. "
