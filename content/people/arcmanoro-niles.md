short_bio: Artist **Arcmanoro Niles** makes vivid, brightly-hued paintings that
  expand our understanding of traditional genre painting and portraiture. His
  paintings, though intensely personal and autobiographical, engage in universal
  subjects of domestic and family life while also making reference to numerous
  art historical predecessors, including Italian and Dutch baroque, history
  painting, Color Field painting, and ancient Egyptian sculpture. Hailing from
  Washington D.C. and born in 1989, Niles attended the Duke Ellington School for
  the Arts. He earned a BFA from Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and an MFA
  from the New York Academy of Art. He currently works and lives in Brooklyn,
  New York.
