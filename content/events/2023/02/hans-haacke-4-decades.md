Hans Haacke is a key figure in contemporary art whose work intersects with conceptual, pop, minimal and land art. Haacke’s strong political, cultural and social concerns are reflected in his installations, texts and sculptures. *Hans Haacke: 4 Decades* follows the artist through his retrospectives in Berlin and Hamburg, documenting his riveting conversation with art historian Jon Bird. The work in these long awaited, non-chronologically arranged exhibitions reveals Haacke’s strong convictions and desire for justice for all.
