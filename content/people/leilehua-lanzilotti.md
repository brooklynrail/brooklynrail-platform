short_bio: "**Leilehua Lanzilotti** is a Kanaka Maoli composer, multimedia
  artist, and curator. A “leading composer–performer” (_The New York Times_),
  Lanzilotti’s work is characterized by expansive explorations of timbre.
  Lanzilotti’s practice explores radical indigenous contemporaneity by
  integrating community engagement and ways of knowing into the heart of
  projects. Lanzilotti was a finalist for the 2022 Pulitzer Prize in Music for
  _with eyes the color of time,_ which the Pulitzer committee called, “a vibrant
  composition … that distinctly combines experimental string textures and
  episodes of melting lyricism.” Dr. Lanzilotti also served as the Curator of
  Music at EMPAC from 2019–21."
