  - person: gordon-knox
    event_bio: Gordon Knox is an educator, a cultural innovator, and an institution
      builder. Knox's work relocates the critical, disciplined investigation and
      knowledge production of art and art-making back to the core of social
      interpretation and cultural transformation. His primary means of
      accomplishing this is by conceptualizing and building effective cultural
      institutions that support artists as agents of social change suspended in
      a global network of public intellectuals, educators, and creative
      practitioners of all sorts. Knox served as president of the San Francisco
      Art Institute (Jan 2017 – May 2020), as Director of the Arizona State
      University Art Museum (2010 – 2016), and as a core collaborator at the
      Stanford Humanities Lab. Knox has built organizations supporting the
      individual creative process by founding the Civitella Ranieri Foundation
      in Italy, establishing the Lucas Artists Programs at Montalvo in
      California, and the Combine Artist Residency program at Arizona State
      University.
