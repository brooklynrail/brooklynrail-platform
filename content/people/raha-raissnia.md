short_bio: "Raha Raissnia learned to paint from filmmakers and musicians rather
  than painters. Years spent at Anthology Film Archives left her well-versed in
  the cinematic avant-garde, and her projection performances often involve
  collaborations with experimental musicians Aki Onda and Charles Curtis. Above
  all, Raissnia’s work aspires to the temporal and experiential condition of
  music—suggestive, ambiguous, abstract. Over the past decade, the artist’s
  paintings, drawings, and films have unfolded within a permutational, self-
  reflexive structure. In her earlier work, the artist presented dense,
  architectonic black and white drawings and paintings that appeared to echo a
  certain postwar European abstraction. "
