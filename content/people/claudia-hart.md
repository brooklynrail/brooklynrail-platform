short_bio: Claudia Hart emerged as part of 90s intermedia artists in the
  “identity art” niche. Her work is about issues of the body, perception, nature
  collapsing into technology. She considers it Cyborg-ish, creating liminal
  spaces, and is in love with the interface between real and unreal because it
  is space of contemplation and transformation. Hart’s work is symbolist and
  poetic. Hart calls her work “post photography,” and has created a body of
  theoretic writings and exhibitions based on this concept. At SAIC, she
  developed a pedagogic program called Experimental 3D, and is the first
  art-school curriculum teaching simulations technologies in the art world. She
  lives in New York and Chicago, shows with Transfer and bitforms galleries and
  is married to Austrian media artist Kurt Hentschlager.
