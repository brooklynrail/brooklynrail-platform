short_bio: "**Candida Alvarez** **Candida Alvarez** is a Puerto Rican artist and
  educator from Brooklyn. She makes paintings and drawings that blur the
  boundaries between the conceptual, the intuitive and the abstract. Complex and
  vibrantly layered with color and shapes built from combinations of abstract
  and figurative forms rich in memory, painting history and references to
  everyday life. Her work has been collected by the Art Institute of Chicago,
  Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Whitney Museum, San Jose Museum of Art,
  among others. Among other awards, Alvarez was recently granted the Arts and
  Letters Award in Art by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Alvarez is
  currently the F.H. Sellers Professor in Painting at the School of the Art
  Institute of Chicago, where she has taught since 1998."
